(In effect, it multiplies his feat-of-strength throwing distance by six.) Using this Knack costs a point of Legend. Mighty Heave does not affect the distance a Scion can throw a normal-sized object, but it does intensify the damage such an object can cause. Thrown weapons or other thrown items that would normally cause bashing damage (a coconut, for example) in\ufb02ict lethal damage and take on the Piercing quality instead when the Scion uses Mighty Heave.

Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool. He must claim the God\u2019s authority when he does so, speaking in the divine figure\u2019s holy name. Characters with this Knack can use it on any willing emissary of equal or lesser Legend. (As the messenger of the Dodekatheon, for instance, Hermes has been a frequent recipient of this effect.) Its remote effect works on a single listener or on a whole group of people. Also, the character\u2019s instructions to her emissary cannot run counter to the effect of the Charisma-based roll she intends to bestow upon that emissary. She cannot, for instance, prepare what looks like a stirring battlefield address on paper but is actually intended to demoralize the troops through whom her chosen generals speaks.",

If the attacker scores more successes than the Scion\u2019s player, his character\u2019s actions proceed as normal. If he scores fewer successes than the Scion, then the difference becomes a bonus to the Scion\u2019s DV against the attacker. This bonus persists for the rest of the scene. For example, if the Scion\u2019s player scores 6 successes on the (Appearance + Presence + Legend) roll and an attacker only manages to eke out 3 successes on his (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll, then the Scion gains a +3 bonus to DV against that attacker for the rest of the scene. This benefit applies against everyone who tries to take action against the Scion for the rest of the scene, though each attacker makes a separate resistance roll. (For the sake of sanity, the Storyteller might wish to roll once and apply a blanket penalty for large groups of extras.) Scions whose Epic Appearance represents divine beauty cannot use this Knack.

Unlike Serpent\u2019s Gaze, though, the Scion need not consciously maintain eye contact with her victim for the effect to endure.

The victim will follow the Scion with his eyes, even turn in place if she wanders around the immediate area, but he can\u2019t do anything other than look at her. What\u2019s more, the Scion can capture a number of victims with her appearance equal to her (Epic Appearance + Legend) total. Her player only spends one point of Legend per person up to the maximum, and they all stop what they\u2019re doing to stare at her in rapt fascination. When the effect ends, they remember nothing that happened after the \ufb01rst moment they saw the Scion. Mortals and Scions of lesser or equal Legend are unable to look away on their own, but Scions with a greater Legend are not so vulnerable. After the Scion using the Knack takes one full action, the higher-Legend victim may spend a point of Willpower to negate the effect.

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend per plant/patch per year \nThe Scion need only touch a large plant (such as a tree or bush) or a one-square-yard patch of smaller plants (from a window box of daisies to a sheet of algae) and spend a point of Legend. That plant or patch can then survive for a whole year (or for its whole life if its natural span is shorter) without food or sunlight or water. The Scion\u2019s ministrations keep the plant healthy through drought, nutrient deficiency, unnatural darkness or other environmental shortfall. The plant\u2019s surroundings must be within its natural tolerances for the plant to survive, though. (This Boon can\u2019t nurture seaweed on the desert floor, for instance.) Also, this Boon doesn\u2019t protect against or cure any blight or damage from herbivorous noshing."

The player rolls (Stamina + Survival) and spends one Legend, and any blight or infestation ends immediately. Blight clears up as if it had never occurred, and vermin suddenly find the affected plants unappealing. This Boon affects a number of large plants (or a number of square yards of a patch of smaller plants) equal to the successes achieved on the roll. This Boon doesn\u2019t protect against future blights, and it stops only the current generation of vermin infestation."

Alternatively, she can curse the land with a blight that either kills the plants within it outright or makes them so attractive to vermin that the resulting infestation has the same effect. The Scion\u2019s player spends three Legend and rolls (Stamina + Survival). The number of successes she rolls determines how many acres she can affect with this power. If one Scion wants to use an aspect of this Boon on a patch of land on which another Scion has used the opposite aspect, a contested roll is called for. Whoever achieves more successes spreads her effect over the larger area, canceling out the lesser effect."
