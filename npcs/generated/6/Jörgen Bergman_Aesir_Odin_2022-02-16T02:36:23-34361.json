If the Scion is sleeping and someone tries to spring an unexpected attack, the player rolls the Scion\u2019s full dice pool to notice the attack as he would if the character were awake (awake and didn\u2019t have this Knack, that is).

He gets a sense of whether the foe has more or fewer dots of Physical Attributes (Epic and otherwise) than he does. The same goes for their relative number of dots in Brawl, Marksmanship, Melee and Thrown, as well as their relative Join Battle dice pools and their soak totals. Also, if some power or special quality renders the foe especially vulnerable or completely invulnerable to something to which the Scion has ready access, the Scion gets a sense of that as well.
