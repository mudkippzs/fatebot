His words convince three members of the mob per success on the roll. This effect lasts for the scene, after which the mob either disperses or renews its shenanigans with its original vigor. If the character is attempting to halt the depredations of a mob that is being controlled or directed supernaturally, use of this Knack constitutes an opposed roll against the other power\u2019s activation roll. If the power has no activation roll per se, the Scion\u2019s player rolls his (Charisma + Presence) against that of the character who incited the mob supernaturally.
