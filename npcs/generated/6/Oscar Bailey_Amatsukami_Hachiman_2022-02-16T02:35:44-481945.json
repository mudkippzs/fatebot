            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Presence \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion adopts some idealized warrior aspect, from howling berserker to unquestioning enlisted man to fearless officer to pitiless samurai. This attitude unnerves and intimidates any opponent who faces him in combat, inflicting a penalty equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend on any attack roll the opponent makes. This penalty applies to any character with a lesser or equal Legend rating who attempts to attack the Scion. This idealized aspect lasts for a number of consecutive actions during the battle equal to the successes the Scion\u2019s player rolled to activate it, and he can invoke it only once during any given battle."

            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Animal Ken \nCost: 1 Willpower \nThe Scion spends one Willpower and names one task that the animal must perform. The task cannot seem suicidal or impossible to the animal, but the animal cannot balk at an order that doesn\u2019t immediately seem so. \u201cHey rabbit, go rip that lion\u2019s throat open,\u201d would seem impossible to the rabbit so commanded. \u201cRun to that grass across this street,\u201d would be a fine order for that same rabbit, though, even if cars were zipping by. The order can describe a single immediate action (\u201cBite that guy!\u201d) or one with a single condition (\u201cCome find me when a blue car stops here.\u201d). If he lacks the previous Boon, the Scion can deliver his command only through simplistic nonverbal signals."
