                "Prerequisite Knack: Mighty Heave (Scion: Demigod, p. 55) A character with Epic Strength can throw normal-sized objects (such as baseballs or darts) ridiculously far. He can also lift incredibly heavy objects. He can even throw those heavy objects, but he can\u2019t throw them very far. A God with the utmost in Strength and Athletics and 10 dots of Epic Strength can throw something he can lift with Epic Strength 9 only about 400 yards away. If the object is big enough \u2014 if it\u2019s a nuclear submarine, for instance, with a bay full of missiles that are about to explode \u2014 400 yards isn\u2019t very far at all. With this Knack, however, a character can hurl an object that he can lift and throw as a feat of strength as far as he can throw a dart without penalties deriving from Range. The sort of epic feats this Knack allow work best as narrative effects in combat, as the logistics of hurling such projectiles as fire stations, the Washington Monument or J\u00f6rmungandr at one\u2019s enemies can get somewhat more math-intensive than is strictly ideal. Hurl to the Moon does not affect the distance a character can throw a normal-sized object, but it does intensify the damage such an object can cause. Such damage is considered aggravated, and the projectile takes on the Piercing quality if it does not already have it. Each attack thus enhanced costs the God two points of Legend, however.",

As long as she continues this specific feat of strength, she ignores hunger, thirst, exhaustion and other factors that might otherwise interrupt her. Without this Knack, a Scion cannot possibly continue a feat of strength longer than a single scene. A Scion can use this Knack to hold up any weight she can lift or keep a creature that\u2019s fastened to a rope or line from getting away. By tightening her neck muscles, she could even hang by her neck without suffocating. The Scion must stay virtually immobile, however. A Scion could keep a mine from caving in, hang from a noose for days or drag a chained beast slowly toward her, but she could not run, jump or perform most combat actions. A Scion is still limited by her normal and Epic Strength ratings, though she can perform feats at the top of her capabilities for days using this Knack.

First, the character can stomp or strike the ground with his \ufb01sts or a weapon, which sends a shock wave outward from him along the ground across an area with a radius equal to his Epic Strength in yards. Striking the ground thus to send out the shock wave requires a Strength roll, which receives the bene\ufb01t of his Epic Strength. Potential victims \u2014 friend and foe alike \u2014 compare their Dodge DV to the results of this roll. If their DV overcomes the Scion\u2019s successes, they manage to jump and let the shock wave pass beneath them. If their DV isn\u2019t high enough, they immediately suffer knockdown as well as an amount of bashing damage equal to however many of the Scion\u2019s successes their DV couldn\u2019t cancel out. (If his allies know the Scion is about to use this Knack \u2014 if his using it is part of a coordinated assault, for instance \u2014 they can jump out of the way preemptively without having to rely on their DVs.) This attack in\ufb02icts no damage on the \ufb02oor or the ground the Scion strikes. All the energy is expended into the shock wave. The second form this power takes is more selective and deliberate. As with the \ufb01rst form, the Scion strikes the ground and sends a shock wave along the surface out to a distance equal to his Epic Strength in yards. This time, though, his player makes a standard Dexterity-based attack roll and targets a single opponent. If that opponent\u2019s Dodge DV isn\u2019t high enough to get him out of the way of the attack, the Scion\u2019s player then makes a Strength roll, modi\ufb01ed by his Epic Strength but not modi\ufb01ed by his extra successes on the attack roll. The damage this attack in\ufb02icts is bashing, but it has one other effect that renders the victim almost helpless for a moment afterward. Any successes on the Strength roll that exceed the victim\u2019s soak not only in\ufb02ict damage but also hurl the victim straight up in the air (one yard per unsoaked success). The victim\u2019s rise and fall takes six ticks, during which his DVs are considered to be halved. He can make ranged attacks at a -5 penalty, but he can\u2019t move or jump or do much of anything until he lands again. In fact, if the Scion\u2019s attack sends him high enough in the air, the victim might take damage from crashing back down from so great a height.

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion stomps a foot or pounds a fist on the bare earth, and a thick cloud of particles of the substance rises into the air around him. This cloud swirls around him and accumulates on his body like a suit of plate armor plus helmet. Any earthen substance will suffice, from gravel to mud to sand. The armor the coating of particles creates has a bashing and lethal Hardness and soak equal to half the Scion\u2019s Legend (rounded up), as well as a mobility penalty equal to that of riot gear. It lasts for the rest of the scene, at the end of which it shatters into a million pieces and falls at the Scion\u2019s feet. A Scion with Shaping (Earth \u2022\u2022\u2022) can craft the armor into a stylized shape, but only if the Scion wearing the armor remains inactive long enough to allow it."

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1+ Legend \nUpon purchasing this Boon, the Scion chooses one of the three attribute categories (Mental, Social or Physical) to associate with this power. Thereafter, the Scion can invoke the principle of Humata (Good Thoughts) and call upon greater reserves of power. The Scion gains a single \u201cWild Card\u201d dot of Epic Attributes, which she may apply to any Attribute within her chosen category. This may raise an Epic Attribute beyond what the character\u2019s Legend rating allows. The character cannot use Humata multiple times to increase an Epic Attribute by more than one, or to increase any other Epic Attributes. Nor does the temporary dot of Epic Attribute grant an additional Knack. Humata (and its successor Boons) cannot raise an Epic Attribute above 10 dots. \nInvoking Humata costs as many Legend points as the final value of the chosen Epic Attibute. The effect lasts for a scene, and cannot be changed until the scene ends. \n Example: A Scion of Anahita has an Epic Intelligence of 2, no Epic Wits, a Legend of 3 and Humata associated with Mental Attributes. She could spends 3 points of Legend and increases her Epic Intelligence to 3, ignoring that her Legend is too low for that rating; or, she could spend 1 Legend to gain one dot of Epic Wits for the rest of the scene."
