Thus, if she\u2019s filled in the first four boxes of her health levels, the Scion gains a +2 bonus on all of her appropriate rolls instead of taking the normal -2 penalty. Even if her Epic Stamina would obviate the penalty in whole or in part, she still gains the full bonus. Scions whose Epic Stamina grants them additional health levels count those boxes as having a -4 penalty (and thus a +4 bonus for purposes of this Knack). Furthermore, every time a Scion using Raging Bull suffers an injury (be it a single level of bashing damage or ten levels of aggravated damage), the player may choose to spend one point of Legend to restore one expended point of Willpower.

To gain the Legend, the Scion must down the drink quickly and with at least a bit of flair. Nursing a beer for an hour isn\u2019t worth Legend, though downing a pint of ale in one long pull and slamming the tankard down on the bar might be. Effectively, the character must turn drinking into a stunt performed for no purpose except to impress onlookers.

In fact, activating this Knack bars a Scion from using his Epic Stamina to resist intoxication. Only normal Stamina applies. Also, characters cannot double-dip for Legend by taking a drink as part of a stunt performed for some other purpose (such a draining a mug of beer then throwing the mug at an enemy\u2019s head as a distraction before an attack).",

                "Prerequisite Knack: Body Armor (Scion: Demigod, pp. 57-58) By concentrating all of his phenomenal stamina on a single point of his body, the Scion can make a tiny area nigh-invulnerable. For a second, the Scion\u2019s ichor seeps into that small point no larger than a fingernail, and that part of the Scion\u2019s body becomes tremendously difficult to damage. The area affected gains a Hardness rating (see Scion: Hero, p. 201) equal to the Scion\u2019s Epic Stamina. Any attack with fewer damage dice than the Hardness rating simply bounces off with no effect, while an attack with more damage dice loses a number of dice equal to the Hardness rating before the Scion attempts to soak it (as a special extension of Hardness, which normally only applies to inanimate objects). The real trick lies in positioning this tiny, invulnerable spot to absorb an attack. Normally, a Scion uses his Parry DV to defect attacks in this fashion. Since the Scion has the Body Armor Knack as a prerequisite, he can already Parry melee attacks. Instead, Invulnerable Nail provides the Scion with a defense against an attack that he can see coming but can\u2019t parry, such as when he\u2019s held in place by a titanspawn\u2019s tentacle and needs to make his forehead momentarily impenetrable to the oncoming needle- tipped appendage that will try to suck out his brain. In such a case, the Scion keeps his full unarmed Parry DV because he can try to defect the attack at the last moment by anticipating where it will strike and fortifying that part of his body. Similarly, a clever Scion might feign suicide by attacking himself with a mundane weapon and defecting it at the last minute through the use of this Knack. Activating this Knack costs two points of Legend. It is a reflexive action done in response to an attack.",

            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Animal Ken \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion stares into the eyes of a specimen of his chosen animal, the one to which his Boon pertains, and overwhelms its mind with his own. For the rest of the scene, the Scion controls the animal\u2019s body just as a character with Horse (Cheval \u2022\u2022\u2022) can control a human\u2019s body. This Boon functions exactly as that one does, with the same limitations and effects on the Scion\u2019s body. The only difference is that Horse applies to possession of a human\u2019s body, while Ride Animal applies to specimens of the Scion\u2019s chosen animal or to his Birthright creature."

            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Integrity \nCost: 1 Willpower + 5 Legend \nThe Amesha Spenta are six principles that represent aspects of the old Persian understanding of the World. For each level of this Boon, the Scion selects an additional Amesha Spenta. \nA mystic aura surrounds a Scion who invokes an Amesha Spenta. The Scion gains a benefit to one of her purviews. If the Scion currently lacks a suitable Birthright for channeling that purview, she can invoke the Boons she knows anyway, at no penalty. (She still needs to own a suitable Birthright and learn Boons as normal: Amesha Spenta Yasht merely offers a chance to channel the purview if the Birthright is unavailable.) If the Scion has her Birthright, then she gains bonus dice equal to her Legend on rolls to activate Boons from that purview. \nThe Scion may only invoke one aura per scene, but the Boon lasts for the remainder of the scene or until the Scion chooses to end it. \n\u2022 Ameretat \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Eternal Life. Associated with all plant life, this Amesha Spenta manifests as a faint shimmer of a green aura surrounding the Scion, twisting at the edges like a vine\u2019s tendrils. Ameretat is associated with the purview of Fertility. \n\u2022 Armaiti \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Holy Devotion. Armaiti is associated with the earth, and appears as a brown or beige aura around the Scion, crumbling at the edges into motes that fall and swirl back into the aura like a trickle of sand. Armaiti is associated with the purview of Earth. \n\u2022 Asha Vahishta \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Best Truth. A red-orange aura flares to life around the Scion, flickering at the edges like flames. Asha Vahishta is associated with the purview of Fire. \n\u2022 Haurvetat \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Perfect Wholeness. Associated with the waters of the world, this Amesha Spenta manifests as a light blue aura in constant motion, flowing smoothly across the Scion\u2019s features. Haurvetat is associated with the purview of Water. \n\u2022 Kshathra \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Righteous Dominion. Kshathra is associated with the sky and metals, and appears as a silver-white aura that flashes with angles and edges. Kshathra is associated with the purview of Sky. \n\u2022 Vohu Manah \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Good Wisdom. No aura appears, but the Scion\u2019s features take an ever-changing animalistic cast \u2014 her eyes might become cat-like one moment, or her skin may seem scaled the next. Vohu Manah is associated with the Animal purview."

            "Dice Pool: Stamina + Animal Ken \nCost: 1 Willpower + (1 Legend per feature) \nThe Scion can change a portion of his anatomy to a shape matching the analogous portion of his chosen animal\u2019s anatomy for one scene. If his chosen animal is an armadillo, he can cover himself in a flexible armor. If his animal is a monkey, he can grow a long prehensile tail that is as dexterous as a hand with no thumb. If his animal is a spider or gecko, he can change the surfaces of his hands and feet to enable himself to climb on walls. If his animal is a bird or bat or airborne insect, he can transform his arms into wings that allow him to fly at a rate equal to his Move rate. The exact effect of the change is up to the player, dependent upon Storyteller approval. As a general guideline, though, if the change boosts some trait or grants bonus dice on a special attack, the total bonus value granted cannot be greater than the character\u2019s Legend."
