The victim remains Inactive for combat purposes, staring helplessly at the hideous monster or unearthly beauty before him. Unlike Serpent\u2019s Gaze, though, the Scion need not consciously maintain eye contact with her victim for the effect to endure. Once the victim has been trans\ufb01xed by the Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance, he remains thus until either the end of the scene or until the Scion leaves his line of sight. The victim will follow the Scion with his eyes, even turn in place if she wanders around the immediate area, but he can\u2019t do anything other than look at her. What\u2019s more, the Scion can capture a number of victims with her appearance equal to her (Epic Appearance + Legend) total. Her player only spends one point of Legend per person up to the maximum, and they all stop what they\u2019re doing to stare at her in rapt fascination. When the effect ends, they remember nothing that happened after the \ufb01rst moment they saw the Scion. Mortals and Scions of lesser or equal Legend are unable to look away on their own, but Scions with a greater Legend are not so vulnerable. After the Scion using the Knack takes one full action, the higher-Legend victim may spend a point of Willpower to negate the effect. In so doing, he remains immune to the effect from the same Scion for the rest of the scene.",

With Microscopic Precision, the Scion\u2019s ability to control fine manipulation becomes so highly attenuated that she can manipulate materials on an absurdly small scale. Armed with nothing more than a pair of tweezers and her own tremendously controlled digits, the Scion can separate dust particles, tweeze out bacteria by hand with a microscope or pluck a tiny corrupting titanspawn hair from a wound, all without disturbing anything around the item. Similarly, the Scion can disable an alarm or a bomb just by teasing out the wires by hand, separate out the threads of the Golden Fleece with her fingers and never lose at the game of Operation.

He need only position himself within the three-dimensional area of the shadow as his player succeeds on the activation roll and spends the point of Legend. If he does so, mundane attempts to find him\u2014even those aided by electronic equipment\u2014fail automatically. Supernatural attempts aided by Epic Perception or an Arete in Awareness (or both) proceed as normal, contesting the searcher\u2019s (Perception + Awareness) against the Scion\u2019s activation roll. The Scion can hide within the shadow as long as it remains large enough. He can move with it as it moves, but doing so might require a new (Dexterity + Stealth) roll depending on the circumstances."

The weapon can be of any shape and size, but the distinction is largely a matter of personal taste, rather than available traits. These weapons do not use the normal traits from the chart in Scion: Hero. Instead, when the character removes the weapon from the fire, the player receives a base number of points equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend for each weapon. These points can add to a base Accuracy +0, Damage +0 and Defense -1, and they can subtract from a starting Speed 6 (reducing it to a minimum of 1). The player assigns the weapon\u2019s traits as the character produces the weapon, and he can\u2019t change them afterward."

Radiated light becomes absorbed when it strikes the Scion\u2019s body, leaving him as a vaguely humanoid-shaped black blot (though still quite solid). In darkness or shadow, the demigod blends in almost perfectly \u2014 he\u2019s just a little too dark, which makes him stand out a bit from the \u201cmundane\u201d darkness around him.

He can draw a bow and walk backward into one shadow then instantly emerge from another shadow somewhere else and fire his arrow just as easily as if he had made a normal Move action before firing.
