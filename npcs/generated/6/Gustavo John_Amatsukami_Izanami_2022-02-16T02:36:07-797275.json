The Scion must spend at least a minute lecturing to a crowd on a particular topic. The Scion\u2019s player then spends two points of Legend and rolls (Charisma + Presence + Legend). For each success scored, one person in the crowd gains temporary use of a Scion\u2019s Ability score. The Scion can perform this quick instruction for any one Ability, but everyone in the crowd hears the same speech and therefore can potentially benefit from the same Ability. For the rest of the scene, those affected by this power may choose to use the Scion\u2019s Ability in place of their own. Heroes can only allow a beneficiary to gain a maximum of three temporary dots in an Ability this way. Demigods can grant up to four dots, while Gods can grant up to five. Such a trick is very useful for turning a disorganized mob into deadly streetfighters (Brawl), creating a temporary squad of EMTs to deal with a disaster (Medicine) or getting the help of a group of inexperienced people in a large construction project, like the pyramids (Craft). Using this Knack does not in any way lower or use up the invoking Scion\u2019s own Ability. The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene.",

This Knack works equally well whether the Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance involves beauty or its opposite. Characters of lesser Legend are unable to break the Scion\u2019s gaze on their own, but those with an equal or greater Legend are not so vulnerable. After the Scion using the Knack takes one full action, the equal- or higher-Legend victim may spend a point of Willpower to negate the effect.

            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Stealth \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion can hide within any shadow into which his body fits. He need only position himself within the three-dimensional area of the shadow as his player succeeds on the activation roll and spends the point of Legend. If he does so, mundane attempts to find him\u2014even those aided by electronic equipment\u2014fail automatically. Supernatural attempts aided by Epic Perception or an Arete in Awareness (or both) proceed as normal, contesting the searcher\u2019s (Perception + Awareness) against the Scion\u2019s activation roll. The Scion can hide within the shadow as long as it remains large enough. He can move with it as it moves, but doing so might require a new (Dexterity + Stealth) roll depending on the circumstances."

            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Craft (to shape) \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion can sculpt stone, concrete, fired clay or metal with his bare hands. When he spends the point of Legend, the substance becomes malleable like wet clay for as long as he touches it. With a successful (Dexterity + Craft) roll by his player, the Scion can shape it into any form his nimble fingers can produce. The Scion can affect up to one cubic foot of material at a time. Once he breaks contact with the substance he is shaping, it loses all malleability and sets in its new form."

The Scion can move only through a volume of earth large enough to accommodate his entire body. Also, unless the Scion has Safely Interred (Earth \u2022), he can remain within the earth for only as long as he can hold his breath. If he stays under longer, he begins to drown. While he\u2019s under, the Scion instinctively knows his way to the nearest air."

            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Occult \nCost: 1 Legend per die of improvement \nWith the proper shows of respect and decorum, a Scion can convince the kami within an object to enhance the mundane function of that object. In so doing, she gains a dice bonus equal to the number of Legend points she spends on the effect, which lasts for a number of days equal to number of successes on the activation roll. Be it anything from a weapon to a baby grand piano, the item must be one that requires a dice roll to use with skill. If the character uses this Boon on one of her Birthright items, she can enhance only its mundane function."

For a single instant, the subject sees everything cast in shadow, with frightening overtones and hideous, nightmarish contortions. This brief second of doubt shakes the target, causing her to lose a single point of Willpower. Afraid of the Dark has no effect on a character with a higher Legend rating than the user. Against someone with an equal or lower Legend score, the defender\u2019s player rolls (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) to shake off the effect."
