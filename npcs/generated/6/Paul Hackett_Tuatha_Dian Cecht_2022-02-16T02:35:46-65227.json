                "The Scion can somehow slip out of the tightest bonds, the most cunning snares and even her opponents\u2019 very \ufb01ngers. Whether she\u2019s tied up and left to stew in her own juices or she\u2019s wrapped in a clinch with a snarling berserker, she rarely remains bound for long. When someone attacks her character with a successful clinch, the Scion\u2019s player not only adds her Epic Dexterity automatic successes to her contested (Dexterity + Brawl) to escape, but she also adds an additional automatic success for every dot of Epic Dexterity her character has. Should the Scion victim\u2019s player succeed on this resistance roll, the Scion slips free of her opponent\u2019s grasping limbs and well out of his reach. Also, should a character be physically restrained\u2014tied up, handcuffed, strapped down, whatever\u2014she can slip her bonds with a divine grace that is nothing short of baf\ufb02ing. The player need only spend a point of Legend, and her character\u2019s handcuffs come undone, her straightjacket\u2019s buckles come loose, or her ropes slough off like a snake\u2019s dried-out skin. The Scion can\u2019t escape thus in view of witnesses, however, unless said witnesses are members of her own heroic Band or are Fatebound to her. Remote witnesses watching via camera transmission don\u2019t hinder the effect, but even close scrutiny of such footage doesn\u2019t reveal how the Scion escaped her bonds. She just did.",

When he\u2019s in the presence of a Fated character whose role has been activated by proximity to someone to whom that Fated person is bound, he gets a tingle up the base of his neck.

                "<Prerequisites> Fast Learner (Scion: Hero, p. 135), Star Pupil (Scion: Demigod, p. 65) Ancient Gods with a particular joy for creation, such as Ptah and Hephaestus, often delight in unleashing strange scientific devices on an unsuspecting populace (or Scion). Scions who turn their prodigious intellect to the construction of curiosities often try to find ways to make useful tools, entertaining toys or devious traps. All three are possible for the mind capable of taking an idea from concept to execution. With Epic Intelligence and the Craft and Science Abilities, a Scion can manufacture a wide range of items, but this Knack enables the Scion to build uncanny devices that defy conventional reason or function. Gadgets created by Scions have three primary possible functions:\n\n\n* Replace another item\u2019s function: For instance, creating a quick repair for a broken carburetor, using an aluminum can and a bicycle tube. Such a fix can temporarily restore function to a \u201cmundane\u201d (non-magical) item, such as a car, a computer or an orbital shuttle.\n\n\n* Temporarily replace a Relic: The Scion can use his innate knowledge of design and creation to make an object that can substitute for a missing or damaged Relic. The replacement allows its wielder to access one Purview that the original missing or damaged Relic normally provided. Replacement Relics require the creating Scion to imbue the item with a bit of ichor as power, which means suffering a level of lethal damage (with no soak) in order to bleed out some ichor to fuel the item.\n\n\n* Perform a specialized new function: The Scion creates a device with functions not found among the more \u201ccommon\u201d tools of the World. The Golden Servant of Hephaestus (Scion: Demigod, pp. 228-229) would be an example of this.\n\n\n",
                "As a general principle, items that replace another item\u2019s function or temporarily replace a Relic are temporary. The Scion\u2019s player spends five points of Legend and rolls (Intelligence + Craft + Legend). The difficulty depends upon the object, as shown in the accompanying table. This is an extended task of the Miscellaneous type, so it can be done in the midst of combat as the Scion theorizes, tears apart available materials and comes up with a solution on the fly. The temporary component functions for one use or (if the crafting Scion\u2019s player spends a point of Willpower) for the rest of the scene.<br/><table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item is larger than a breadbox or smaller than a car key</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item is larger than a person or smaller than a thumbtack</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item is larger than a car or smaller than a grain of rice</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item is larger than a battleship or microscopic</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complexity</td>\n<td>Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item has many moving parts</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item has many intricate moving parts</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item uses electricity</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item uses micro-circuitry</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dramatic Relation</td>\n<td>Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item has only a peripheral relation to the story</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item has no relation to the story</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item runs counter to part of story, theme or plot</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n</table>",
                "Specialized new items rely on the Scion exploiting (or writing) new scientific principles. Creation of such devices can take months or years of time; the extended test uses (Intelligence + Science + Legend) to theorize the item, then (Intelligence + Craft + Legend) to build it. The difficulty for such a task typically begins at 35 and can increase due to object size and complexity (as well as how relevant it is to the story at hand; see the sidebar for some suggestions). If the item performs some otherwise impossible task or would radically change day-to-day life for the common man \u2014 cheap, clean fusion power, flying cars starting at $100, an algorithm that proves that P = NP \u2014 the base difficulty ranges from 50 to 100, and the task can only be completed by a God. Thanks to the interference of Fate, any object that would completely hamstring a dramatic moment or reshape the cosmic order is simply beyond the magnitude of capabilities for even a God with this Knack. Also, the Scion must have some sort of tools or materials to work with. Trapped in the Mojave, the Scion can\u2019t make a moisture condenser out of sand, but in a junkyard, the Scion could construct a miniature tank.",

It is an insult to enech \u2014 pretending to be something less then you are is as bad as pretending to be something better. Thus, the Scion who uses this Boon chooses to declaim his best attributes and admit to his weakest. The Scion must choose which Virtues he is going to declaim about himself at the time of the Boon\u2019s activation. The difficulty of the roll is equal to the rating of the highest Virtue he is invoking, +1 per additional Virtue."
