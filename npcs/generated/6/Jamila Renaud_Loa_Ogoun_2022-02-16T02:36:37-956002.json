With this Knack, any tool or item that the Scion picks up benefits from the same bends and loopholes in the laws of physics that allow Epic Strength to defy both leverage and structural integrity. The Scion could use a wooden board to clobber a thug, or he could ram a flimsy iron fireplace poker right through a wall of concrete with the full force of his Epic Strength. In either case, the tool would remain reasonably intact (albeit with some cosmetic wear). Such guarantees are particularly handy when using an object of questionable strength to beat a titanspawn to death without destroying the item in question (such as a snow globe intended as a present). Note that Titanium Tools doesn\u2019t improve the Hardness or rigidity of an item. A cheap katana can still be snapped in half by an angry titanspawn that decides to target the blade. A limp spaghetti noodle is no better a weapon with this Knack than without. Titanium Tools simply allows the Scion to use objects that might be feasible as weapons under normal circumstances and subject them to the extraordinary effects of his Epic Strength without breaking them, for as long as he wields the object.",

Doing so costs one Willpower, and the command must be one the Scion can give and the victim can perform in a single action. \u201cFreeze!\u201d is acceptable, as is, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d or, \u201cShoot him!\u201d Ordering someone to go home and shoot his wife won\u2019t work because doing so would take longer than a single action. A victim of this Knack can interpret the command loosely to make it not directly suicidal, but not if all he\u2019s trying to do is keep out of trouble. For example, if a victim draws a gun and the Scion commands him to shoot himself, the victim can shoot himself in the hand or the foot rather than blowing his own brains out. Same thing goes if a Scion uses this Knack at a seedy pool hall to command a smarmy drug dealer to pick a \ufb01ght with a burly ex-con at the next table. The dealer might reasonably believe that the ex-con could kill him, but he still can\u2019t weasel out of the command. He doesn\u2019t have to walk up and take a swing at the guy, but he still has to do something, such as singing out a racial slur or throwing a beer bottle at the guy\u2019s girlfriend.

                "The Scion is so strong that he can direct his incredible power through the ground or \ufb02oor to affect enemies at range. Doing so takes two separate forms. First, the character can stomp or strike the ground with his \ufb01sts or a weapon, which sends a shock wave outward from him along the ground across an area with a radius equal to his Epic Strength in yards. Striking the ground thus to send out the shock wave requires a Strength roll, which receives the bene\ufb01t of his Epic Strength. Potential victims \u2014 friend and foe alike \u2014 compare their Dodge DV to the results of this roll. If their DV overcomes the Scion\u2019s successes, they manage to jump and let the shock wave pass beneath them. If their DV isn\u2019t high enough, they immediately suffer knockdown as well as an amount of bashing damage equal to however many of the Scion\u2019s successes their DV couldn\u2019t cancel out. (If his allies know the Scion is about to use this Knack \u2014 if his using it is part of a coordinated assault, for instance \u2014 they can jump out of the way preemptively without having to rely on their DVs.) This attack in\ufb02icts no damage on the \ufb02oor or the ground the Scion strikes. All the energy is expended into the shock wave. The second form this power takes is more selective and deliberate. As with the \ufb01rst form, the Scion strikes the ground and sends a shock wave along the surface out to a distance equal to his Epic Strength in yards. This time, though, his player makes a standard Dexterity-based attack roll and targets a single opponent. If that opponent\u2019s Dodge DV isn\u2019t high enough to get him out of the way of the attack, the Scion\u2019s player then makes a Strength roll, modi\ufb01ed by his Epic Strength but not modi\ufb01ed by his extra successes on the attack roll. The damage this attack in\ufb02icts is bashing, but it has one other effect that renders the victim almost helpless for a moment afterward. Any successes on the Strength roll that exceed the victim\u2019s soak not only in\ufb02ict damage but also hurl the victim straight up in the air (one yard per unsoaked success). The victim\u2019s rise and fall takes six ticks, during which his DVs are considered to be halved. He can make ranged attacks at a -5 penalty, but he can\u2019t move or jump or do much of anything until he lands again. In fact, if the Scion\u2019s attack sends him high enough in the air, the victim might take damage from crashing back down from so great a height.
