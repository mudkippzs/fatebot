                "As Scions build up ever more dots of Epic Appearance, they grow ever more unearthly. As such, whether they\u2019re beautiful or quite the opposite, it becomes increasingly difficult to deal with mortal humans on their level. The Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance can\u2019t help but get in the way. This Knack, however, mitigates that factor. When the Scion\u2019s player spends a point of Willpower to activate it for the scene, any mortals who see the character completely ignore his Appearance score (both Epic and mundane). Witnesses might vaguely remember that a beautiful Scion was kind of pretty or that a disgustingly ugly Scion was dirty and a little scary, but that\u2019s it. They won\u2019t recognize the Scion again later unless the Scion uses this Knack in their presence again, and they won\u2019t be able to describe the Scion in great detail to anyone else. They might get height, hair color, skin tone, build and style of dress right, but details beyond those generalities prove elusive. Scions themselves are immune to this effect, as they are more than capable of dealing with the extremes that Epic Appearance represents. This Knack lasts for the scene, though the Scion can choose to turn off the effect before then. Also, while he\u2019s using this Knack to deal with a mortal, he cannot use any other Epic Appearance Knacks against him. Nor can he apply his Epic Appearance to rolls pertaining to dealing with that mortal at all until he lifts the effect.",

Unlike Serpent\u2019s Gaze, though, the Scion need not consciously maintain eye contact with her victim for the effect to endure.

The victim will follow the Scion with his eyes, even turn in place if she wanders around the immediate area, but he can\u2019t do anything other than look at her. What\u2019s more, the Scion can capture a number of victims with her appearance equal to her (Epic Appearance + Legend) total. Her player only spends one point of Legend per person up to the maximum, and they all stop what they\u2019re doing to stare at her in rapt fascination. When the effect ends, they remember nothing that happened after the \ufb01rst moment they saw the Scion.

The Scion spends one Legend point and her player rolls (Stamina + Medicine). For each success scored, one target gains one temporary health level. This bonus health level lasts for the remainder of the scene. When the health level disappears, any wounds that filled it also subside; it does not overflow into normal damage."

The only thing a character can\u2019t do in midair that he could do on the ground is jump, as there\u2019s nothing to jump off of."
