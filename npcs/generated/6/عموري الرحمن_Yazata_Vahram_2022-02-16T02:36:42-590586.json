With this Knack, any tool or item that the Scion picks up benefits from the same bends and loopholes in the laws of physics that allow Epic Strength to defy both leverage and structural integrity. The Scion could use a wooden board to clobber a thug, or he could ram a flimsy iron fireplace poker right through a wall of concrete with the full force of his Epic Strength. In either case, the tool would remain reasonably intact (albeit with some cosmetic wear). Such guarantees are particularly handy when using an object of questionable strength to beat a titanspawn to death without destroying the item in question (such as a snow globe intended as a present). Note that Titanium Tools doesn\u2019t improve the Hardness or rigidity of an item. A cheap katana can still be snapped in half by an angry titanspawn that decides to target the blade. A limp spaghetti noodle is no better a weapon with this Knack than without. Titanium Tools simply allows the Scion to use objects that might be feasible as weapons under normal circumstances and subject them to the extraordinary effects of his Epic Strength without breaking them, for as long as he wields the object.",

A God with the utmost in Strength and Athletics and 10 dots of Epic Strength can throw something he can lift with Epic Strength 9 only about 400 yards away. If the object is big enough \u2014 if it\u2019s a nuclear submarine, for instance, with a bay full of missiles that are about to explode \u2014 400 yards isn\u2019t very far at all. With this Knack, however, a character can hurl an object that he can lift and throw as a feat of strength as far as he can throw a dart without penalties deriving from Range. The sort of epic feats this Knack allow work best as narrative effects in combat, as the logistics of hurling such projectiles as fire stations, the Washington Monument or J\u00f6rmungandr at one\u2019s enemies can get somewhat more math-intensive than is strictly ideal. Hurl to the Moon does not affect the distance a character can throw a normal-sized object, but it does intensify the damage such an object can cause. Such damage is considered aggravated, and the projectile takes on the Piercing quality if it does not already have it. Each attack thus enhanced costs the God two points of Legend, however.",

The Scion cannot hear what is happening around a distant fire, and his field of vision remains the same through the fire as it is through his eyes. He may physically move his head or turn his body in place to change his remote perspective, though. While he looks through the fire, the Scion can\u2019t see from his own perspective. He may maintain his remote perspective for as long as he wishes."

            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Animal Ken \nCost: 1 Willpower \nThe Scion spends one Willpower and names one task that the animal must perform. The task cannot seem suicidal or impossible to the animal, but the animal cannot balk at an order that doesn\u2019t immediately seem so. \u201cHey rabbit, go rip that lion\u2019s throat open,\u201d would seem impossible to the rabbit so commanded. \u201cRun to that grass across this street,\u201d would be a fine order for that same rabbit, though, even if cars were zipping by. The order can describe a single immediate action (\u201cBite that guy!\u201d) or one with a single condition (\u201cCome find me when a blue car stops here.\u201d). If he lacks the previous Boon, the Scion can deliver his command only through simplistic nonverbal signals."

            "Dice Pool: Integrity + Legend \nCost: 10 Legend \nWhen the Scion uses this Boon, one of her chosen Amesha Spentas manifests to assist her. The aura of the Amesha Spenta flows off her body to coalesce as an abstract humanoid figure formed of the physical principle of the Amesha Spenta (i.e., fire for Asha Vahishta, water for Haurvetat, etc.) \nThe Amesha Spenta has all the Scion\u2019s dice pools and can use all the Boons that the Scion knows from the relevant purview. It acts by the Scion\u2019s will, but takes its own actions. As an abstract concept given form, though, the mystic helper cannot do anything but move and use Boons. It also uses the Scion\u2019s Legend to power those Boons. No mundane force can harm an Amesha Spenta, but attacks backed by Epic Attributes, Arete, or other supernatural means deal damage as normal. The Amesha Spenta has soak equal to the Scion\u2019s natural soak (including Epic Stamina) and it has five \u20130 Health levels. \nThis Boon may be used once per scene. The Amesha Spenta lasts for one minute per success on the activation roll. \nThe Scion may also select a fifth Amesha Spenta to associate with Asha, as per the previous Boon."

            "Humata (Asha \u2022)",
            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1+ Legend \nUpon purchasing this Boon, the Scion chooses one of the three attribute categories (Mental, Social or Physical) to associate with this power. Thereafter, the Scion can invoke the principle of Humata (Good Thoughts) and call upon greater reserves of power. The Scion gains a single \u201cWild Card\u201d dot of Epic Attributes, which she may apply to any Attribute within her chosen category. This may raise an Epic Attribute beyond what the character\u2019s Legend rating allows. The character cannot use Humata multiple times to increase an Epic Attribute by more than one, or to increase any other Epic Attributes. Nor does the temporary dot of Epic Attribute grant an additional Knack. Humata (and its successor Boons) cannot raise an Epic Attribute above 10 dots. \nInvoking Humata costs as many Legend points as the final value of the chosen Epic Attibute. The effect lasts for a scene, and cannot be changed until the scene ends. \n Example: A Scion of Anahita has an Epic Intelligence of 2, no Epic Wits, a Legend of 3 and Humata associated with Mental Attributes. She could spends 3 points of Legend and increases her Epic Intelligence to 3, ignoring that her Legend is too low for that rating; or, she could spend 1 Legend to gain one dot of Epic Wits for the rest of the scene."
