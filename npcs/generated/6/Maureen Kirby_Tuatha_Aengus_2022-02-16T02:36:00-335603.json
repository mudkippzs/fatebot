Attempting to hypnotize a fellow Scion of lesser or equal (Willpower + Legend) requires not only a Willpower expenditure but a (Manipulation + Command + Legend) roll contested against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). Scions cannot instantly hypnotize fellow Scions of higher (Willpower + Legend). Should he successfully hypnotize a victim, the Scion can implant one hidden command that the victim must obey at the time of the Scion\u2019s choosing. The command must be something that the victim can accomplish in one scene, and the trigger condition that compels him to attempt it must occur within a number of months equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. The Scion can give as speci\ufb01c an order as he pleases, and a mortal cannot interpret it in any way other than the spirit in which it was intended. A fellow Scion can interpret it loosely to his own advantage, as per Overt Order, but doing so costs him a point of Willpower. The victim remains unaware of the ticking time bomb in his subconscious, but he does have a chance to resist it when the trigger condition occurs. At the moment when he has been commanded to perform the action in question, the victim\u2019s player may make a (Wits + Integrity) roll. (This roll cannot be modi\ufb01ed by a Scion\u2019s Epic Wits or an Integrity Arete.) If the roll garners more successes than the hypnotist Scion has dots of Legend, the compulsion is broken. If the last-minute resistance roll fails, the victim must attempt to do as he was commanded. Whether he succeeds or fails, the compulsion ends after he makes the attempt, and he has no memory of what could possibly have convinced him to do as he did.",

At the very least, you want to know if the minion was killed in the attempt. With Return to Sender, the Scion prompts someone to return immediately to her after performing a task delegated with Epic Manipulation. The player spends an additional point of Legend to activate this power when using any other Epic Manipulation Knack to force a subject to take an action.

Spending a point of Legend and a point of Willpower, the Scion burns a mental vision of himself so deeply into the victim\u2019s mind that everyone the victim sees thereafter who\u2019s of the same sex as the Scion seems to be wearing the Scion\u2019s face. This effect is especially jarring because other features such as height, weight, hairstyle, skin tone and whatnot don\u2019t change from what\u2019s natural for the person the victim is actually seeing. Only the Scion\u2019s face stands out, sized and colored as appropriate for the person on hand, yet still undeniably the Scion\u2019s own. Shaking off this disorienting hallucination costs the victim a point of Willpower, but that doesn\u2019t end the effect. An hour later, the effect creeps back up on the victim until every person of the appropriate gender has the Scion\u2019s face again. Even worse, a character cannot regain spent Willpower points while he\u2019s languishing under this effect. The only hope for a mortal victim is that the Scion will track him down and decide to end the effect. The demigod can do the same for Scion victims as well, but in the children of the Gods, the effect will wear off on its own after the victim has spent 24 hours with no points of Willpower.",

                "Scions of Hel are almost always awesomely hideous, while Scions of Aphrodite are generally phenomenally attractive. With this Knack, though, a Scion can have the best of both worlds. Once a Scion chooses this Knack, she can shift her Epic Appearance from hideous to beautiful at will. The player simply expends the requisite Legend cost and the Scion\u2019s mien transforms. In either form, she is still recognizable as herself; she cannot use this Knack to change her appearance, unless she also has a Knack like Detail Variation from p. 71 of Scion: God. However, she can change from an elegant, refined woman to a vengeful, nerve-wracking hag in the blink of an eye. Once she transforms thus, her range of available Epic Appearance Knacks shifts as appropriate. While beautiful, then, the Scion can invoke all of her known Epic Appearance Knacks that rely on great beauty; while hideous, she can invoke any of her Epic Appearance Knacks that require a monstrous countenance. Once a Scion learns this Knack, she can freely purchase any Epic Appearance Knack that would normally require incredible beauty or incredible monstrosity. She can only use the Knacks appropriate to the form that she currently bears, though. Activating this Knack costs three points of Legend. The Scion remains in her switched state until she decides to activate the Knack again. (Indeed, both of them are her \u201cnatural\u201d state; she simply has the ability to swap between them as desired.)"

The task cannot seem suicidal or impossible to the animal, but the animal cannot balk at an order that doesn\u2019t immediately seem so. \u201cHey rabbit, go rip that lion\u2019s throat open,\u201d would seem impossible to the rabbit so commanded. \u201cRun to that grass across this street,\u201d would be a fine order for that same rabbit, though, even if cars were zipping by. The order can describe a single immediate action (\u201cBite that guy!\u201d) or one with a single condition (\u201cCome find me when a blue car stops here.\u201d). If he lacks the previous Boon, the Scion can deliver his command only through simplistic nonverbal signals."

On one hand, he can heal as many health levels of bashing damage as his player gets successes on a (Stamina + Medicine) roll. Doing so costs one Legend. Alternatively, he can downgrade a number of health levels equal to successes on the roll from lethal to bashing damage. Doing so costs one Willpower."

This roll is opposed by the target\u2019s (Wits + Integrity + Legend), and the roll itself has a difficulty of the target\u2019s Legend +1. If this roll is successful, the target is bound by a geas of Token potency for two months per net success in the roll, to a maximum of a year and a day. Alternately, if the Scion expends a full dot (rather than a point) of Willpower, the geas is laid permanently."
