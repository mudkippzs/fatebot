This Knack expands the scope of the effect so that a character can hypnotize a whole group of people. The character\u2019s player rolls (Manipulation + Command + Legend) and spends a point of Legend and a point of Willpower. If the roll scores more successes than the average (Willpower + Legend) of the assembled audience, the character successfully implants the post-hypnotic suggestion in as many members of the audience as he has successes on the roll. Mortals cannot resist the effect or the compulsion to perform the implanted action. Characters with a Legend rating resist at the moment of hypnosis or at the moment the action is designated to take place, as with Instant Hypnosis.

The cost, dice pool, restrictions and resistance mechanics of this Knack are the same as for Instant Hypnosis.

The name of this Knack, however, speaks for itself. Any action the character can perform as a feat of strength, he can perform as if it\u2019s no effort at all. He can lift the heaviest weights with one hand while using his other hand to cover a yawn. He can throw a spear into orbit with a flick of his finger. He can scoop the beached whale up in one hand and send it skipping like a stone out into the deep water where it can move freely (if dizzily) once again.

With just a flick of a finger, a jab of an elbow or a headbutt, the Scion delivers the entire force of her Epic Strength. Although this doesn\u2019t necessarily change the Scion\u2019s unarmed combat style \u2014 she still needs to land a strike on an enemy \u2014 it\u2019s quite intimidating when she can simply poke a building and cause an entire wall to crumble. Similarly, if the Scion is somehow restrained but able to move even a minuscule part of her body, she could (for instance) flick a tiny rock with her toe with enough force to kill a man. While this does not increase the Scion\u2019s damage output, it means that even when bound or restricted from moving in some way, the Scion can still bring all of her Epic Strength to bear in an attack. Perhaps she\u2019s chained with bindings made from Gleipnir and can\u2019t break them, but she can head-butt her assailant. Maybe she is buried in rock and can only move her little finger but can use that to send the boulder on the top of the heap flying. Her damage output and ability to lift are not impinged in any way when she\u2019s forced to rely only on a single limb, a part of her body or a restricted range of motion.
