                "The Scion is so strong that he can direct his incredible power through the ground or \ufb02oor to affect enemies at range. Doing so takes two separate forms. First, the character can stomp or strike the ground with his \ufb01sts or a weapon, which sends a shock wave outward from him along the ground across an area with a radius equal to his Epic Strength in yards. Striking the ground thus to send out the shock wave requires a Strength roll, which receives the bene\ufb01t of his Epic Strength. Potential victims \u2014 friend and foe alike \u2014 compare their Dodge DV to the results of this roll. If their DV overcomes the Scion\u2019s successes, they manage to jump and let the shock wave pass beneath them. If their DV isn\u2019t high enough, they immediately suffer knockdown as well as an amount of bashing damage equal to however many of the Scion\u2019s successes their DV couldn\u2019t cancel out. (If his allies know the Scion is about to use this Knack \u2014 if his using it is part of a coordinated assault, for instance \u2014 they can jump out of the way preemptively without having to rely on their DVs.) This attack in\ufb02icts no damage on the \ufb02oor or the ground the Scion strikes. All the energy is expended into the shock wave. The second form this power takes is more selective and deliberate. As with the \ufb01rst form, the Scion strikes the ground and sends a shock wave along the surface out to a distance equal to his Epic Strength in yards. This time, though, his player makes a standard Dexterity-based attack roll and targets a single opponent. If that opponent\u2019s Dodge DV isn\u2019t high enough to get him out of the way of the attack, the Scion\u2019s player then makes a Strength roll, modi\ufb01ed by his Epic Strength but not modi\ufb01ed by his extra successes on the attack roll. The damage this attack in\ufb02icts is bashing, but it has one other effect that renders the victim almost helpless for a moment afterward. Any successes on the Strength roll that exceed the victim\u2019s soak not only in\ufb02ict damage but also hurl the victim straight up in the air (one yard per unsoaked success). The victim\u2019s rise and fall takes six ticks, during which his DVs are considered to be halved. He can make ranged attacks at a -5 penalty, but he can\u2019t move or jump or do much of anything until he lands again. In fact, if the Scion\u2019s attack sends him high enough in the air, the victim might take damage from crashing back down from so great a height. Using either form of this Knack requires the expenditure of one Legend point.",

With Return to Sender, the Scion prompts someone to return immediately to her after performing a task delegated with Epic Manipulation.

Immediately after performing the order, the commanded subject will attempt to return to the Scion by the most convenient means possible, although not at the expense of his own safety.

This Knack, however, doubles a Scion\u2019s vertical and horizontal jumping distances.

With a few well-chosen words to reinforce the subject\u2019s awareness of the situation, though, a Scion with this Knack can help people snap out of the unnatural influence of others. The player spends Legend equal to the cost of the power being countered plus one (plus an additional three Legend for every point of Willpower spent on the power being countered), then rolls (Manipulation + Presence + Legend). If the player rolls more successes than the original command, the subject immediately snaps out of it and realizes that he didn\u2019t want to do whatever it is that he was compelled to do. If the original power didn\u2019t require a roll to succeed (like Overt Order), then the Scion\u2019s player must simply score a number of successes equal to the original commander\u2019s (Manipulation + Command + Legend). In order to countermand a specific Epic Charisma or Epic Manipulation Knack, the Scion using Deprogramming must also know the Knack being used.

            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Control \nCost: 1 Willpower + 3 Legend \nThis Boon is very similar to Horse (Cheval 3), in that it lets a Scion take total control of a mortal victim\u2019s body for a limited time, manipulating it as if it were her own. As with Horse, the Scion must be using Rada\u2019s Eyes (Cheval 1) on the victim first in order to use this Boon. Having done so, the Scion\u2019s player makes the activation roll for this Boon (contested as per Horse) and spends the requisite Willpower and Legend. If this roll succeeds, the Scion\u2019s body becomes entirely incorporeal and steps into the body of her victim like a ghost taking possession of it."

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend per weapon \nThe Scion reaches into a flame that\u2019s at least as big as a campfire and pulls out a blazing melee weapon made of flickering fire. The weapon can be of any shape and size, but the distinction is largely a matter of personal taste, rather than available traits. These weapons do not use the normal traits from the chart in Scion: Hero. Instead, when the character removes the weapon from the fire, the player receives a base number of points equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend for each weapon. These points can add to a base Accuracy +0, Damage +0 and Defense -1, and they can subtract from a starting Speed 6 (reducing it to a minimum of 1). The player assigns the weapon\u2019s traits as the character produces the weapon, and he can\u2019t change them afterward."

            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Control \nCost: 1 Willpower + 1 Legend \nThe Scion can now exert total control over her victim for a limited time. She must be using Rada\u2019s Eyes to share the victim\u2019s perceptions, and she must spend a point of Willpower and a point of Legend to assert full control. (The victim\u2019s chance to resist is the same as for Petro\u2019s Hands.) If the Scion succeeds in her possession attempt, she can \u201cride\u201d around inside her victim\u2019s body for one scene (or less if she chooses to end the effect early). She exerts all of her own mundane traits, except for Appearance, through the effectively empty husk, losing all sense of the situation around her own body."

            "Dice Pool: Manipulation + Cheval \nCost: 1 Willpower \nWhen the Scion has a mortal victim completely under her control, she can temporarily pull the victim\u2019s spirit out of his body and boss the body around as her mindless slave. The Scion must somehow incapacitate the victim\u2014by tying him up, drugging him, beating him unconscious or whatever\u2014then cover the victim\u2019s mouth with her own and take a long, deep breath. The victim\u2019s player then rolls (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) against the activation roll. If the activation roll wins, the Scion sucks out the victim\u2019s spirit and swallows it down into the darkness within her. Once that happens, the victim maintains a dreamlike semi-awareness of what the Scion is doing, just as a victim of Horse (Cheval 3) does, but he can\u2019t take any actions or exert his own will in any way."
