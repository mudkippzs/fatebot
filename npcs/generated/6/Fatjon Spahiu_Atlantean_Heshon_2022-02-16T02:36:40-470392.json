                "As Scions build up ever more dots of Epic Appearance, they grow ever more unearthly. As such, whether they\u2019re beautiful or quite the opposite, it becomes increasingly difficult to deal with mortal humans on their level. The Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance can\u2019t help but get in the way. This Knack, however, mitigates that factor. When the Scion\u2019s player spends a point of Willpower to activate it for the scene, any mortals who see the character completely ignore his Appearance score (both Epic and mundane). Witnesses might vaguely remember that a beautiful Scion was kind of pretty or that a disgustingly ugly Scion was dirty and a little scary, but that\u2019s it. They won\u2019t recognize the Scion again later unless the Scion uses this Knack in their presence again, and they won\u2019t be able to describe the Scion in great detail to anyone else. They might get height, hair color, skin tone, build and style of dress right, but details beyond those generalities prove elusive. Scions themselves are immune to this effect, as they are more than capable of dealing with the extremes that Epic Appearance represents. This Knack lasts for the scene, though the Scion can choose to turn off the effect before then. Also, while he\u2019s using this Knack to deal with a mortal, he cannot use any other Epic Appearance Knacks against him. Nor can he apply his Epic Appearance to rolls pertaining to dealing with that mortal at all until he lifts the effect.",

                "Prerequisite Knack: Holy Bound (Scion: Hero, p. 126) A character with this Knack cannot necessarily fly, but the difference between using this Knack and flying is a subtlety that is easily lost on mortal onlookers. For the cost of 10 Legend points, this Knack converts the distance increment a character can jump from yards to hundreds of yards. That is, the character can leap the distance of one football field straight up for every dot of (Strength + Athletics) she has plus the bonus number granted by her Epic Strength. She can jump twice that length horizontally. At Strength 12, Athletics 5 and Epic Strength 10 (plus accounting for this Knack\u2019s prerequisite), the character can leap a little bit more than seven miles straight up \u2014 which is about one and a half miles higher than the peak of Mount Everest \u2014 or more than 14 miles horizontally. Used in combat, this Knack makes jumping something more than a Speed 5 miscellaneous action. When a character takes a leap that can potentially carry her for miles, that action is typically narrated rather than played out tick by tick. If no one can fly after her, leap after her or run fast enough to keep up with her, the character effectively leaves combat. In \u201cflight,\u201d the character retains her full DVs and attack dice pools. This Knack also makes jumping more dangerous than it normally is. Normally, a character can always safely fall from the maximum height to which she can normally jump. This Knack, however, overrides that safety standard by extending a person\u2019s jumping height to preposterous extremes. If a character who uses this Knack to leap aeronautically is successfully attacked in flight and that attack inflicts enough damage to cause knockdown or knockback, the character\u2019s prodigious leap turns into an uncontrolled fall. The player gets one chance per dot of Epic Strength the character has to succeed on a (Dexterity + Athletics) roll. If she does succeed, the character retains her aerial poise and lands, if not gracefully, at least safely. If the roll fails, the character suffers damage relevant to falling from a great height.",

            "Natural Camouflage",
            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Stealth \nCost: 1 Legend \nWhen the Scion hides in her verdant element, it\u2019s almost impossible to find her. Her skin sprouts grass, bark, underbrush, flowers, mushrooms or what have you that allow her to blend in seamlessly with her natural surroundings. As long as she doesn\u2019t move or otherwise draw attention to herself, mundane attempts to find or track her fail automatically. A mortal hunter with a trusty hound could walk right over the Scion\u2019s disguised back and never know she was there. Hunters of supernatural prowess fare only a little better. Those with the Epic Perception Knack Predatory Focus or a Survival Arete can attempt to track the hidden Scion\u2019s movements, their players rolling (Perception + Survival) against the hiding Scion\u2019s activation roll. Even if they get more successes than the Scion\u2019s player did, though, the hunters find only the general area in which the Scion is hiding. (They come to an area within a number of yards equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend but lose track of her unless she moves again.) Only hunters with the Supernal Hunter Knack are actually skilled enough to find a Scion who\u2019s using this Boon to hide (and only if their rolls garner more successes than the Scion\u2019s)."

            "Toxic Thorn",
            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Science \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion sprouts a single thorn from his hand or foot, which he can use in conjunction with an unarmed strike to poison a victim. Successes scored by the player on an (Intelligence + Science) roll determines the strength of the poison that can be created. Consult the accompanying table for its toxicity:"

            "Ride Animal",
            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Animal Ken \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion stares into the eyes of a specimen of his chosen animal, the one to which his Boon pertains, and overwhelms its mind with his own. For the rest of the scene, the Scion controls the animal\u2019s body just as a character with Horse (Cheval \u2022\u2022\u2022) can control a human\u2019s body. This Boon functions exactly as that one does, with the same limitations and effects on the Scion\u2019s body. The only difference is that Horse applies to possession of a human\u2019s body, while Ride Animal applies to specimens of the Scion\u2019s chosen animal or to his Birthright creature."

            "Animal Command",
            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Animal Ken \nCost: 1 Willpower \nThe Scion spends one Willpower and names one task that the animal must perform. The task cannot seem suicidal or impossible to the animal, but the animal cannot balk at an order that doesn\u2019t immediately seem so. \u201cHey rabbit, go rip that lion\u2019s throat open,\u201d would seem impossible to the rabbit so commanded. \u201cRun to that grass across this street,\u201d would be a fine order for that same rabbit, though, even if cars were zipping by. The order can describe a single immediate action (\u201cBite that guy!\u201d) or one with a single condition (\u201cCome find me when a blue car stops here.\u201d). If he lacks the previous Boon, the Scion can deliver his command only through simplistic nonverbal signals."

            "Dice Pool: Stamina + Survival \nCost: 1 Legend \nEvery gardener and farmer has to deal with blight or vermin sometimes, but doing so is easy for a Scion with this Boon. The player rolls (Stamina + Survival) and spends one Legend, and any blight or infestation ends immediately. Blight clears up as if it had never occurred, and vermin suddenly find the affected plants unappealing. This Boon affects a number of large plants (or a number of square yards of a patch of smaller plants) equal to the successes achieved on the roll. This Boon doesn\u2019t protect against future blights, and it stops only the current generation of vermin infestation."
