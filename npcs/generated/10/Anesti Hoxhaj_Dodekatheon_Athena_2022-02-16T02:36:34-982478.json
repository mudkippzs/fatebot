                "Prerequisite Knack: Opening Salvo It\u2019s pretty nice to be able to lay into someone with a witty bon mot and shake his faith in himself, as the prerequisite Knack allows. Yet, it\u2019s undeniably sweeter to let some pompous douchebag take the first swing and then utterly annihilate him with a cunning verbal riposte. To hit an attacker with a devastating comeback costs a single point of Legend. Doing so strips the victim of all of his spent Willpower points and doesn\u2019t allow him to recoup those lost points for one full day. A character can use this Knack to defend herself from a use of Opening Salvo if she has the Legend point to spend and her comeback is timely enough. A victim, however, can defend himself from a use of this Knack if he also uses this Knack. (He can retort without using the Knack, of course, but he still suffers the effect.) If two characters use this Knack in a verbal exchange, they can activate it once apiece and then trade insults until one scores a decisive hit over the other. If that victim\u2019s comeback is weaker than the one before it, he loses the impromptu contest and the Willpower points. As with Opening Salvo, the player must actually come up with a retort reasonably quickly. She doesn\u2019t have to be Hamlet running circles around Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, she just has to give it the old college try. Be warned, though: If you (the player) know you get tongue-tied when the heat is on and your Storyteller or fellow players are ruthless bastards, this Knack might not be the one for you.",

The best makeup and disguise means nothing if the imposter can\u2019t react to life\u2019s little surprises exactly as the subject of his mimicry would react. With this Knack, however, the Scion can discern with preternatural quickness how the people who think he\u2019s someone else expect that someone else to react. Their minute changes of expression or body language give their expectations away, allowing the imposter to react accordingly. For the most part, this Knack plays itself out without resorting to dice rolls or trait comparisons. As the imposter\u2019s player roleplays (and the imposter himself does so also), the Storyteller simply informs him of what the unsuspecting characters\u2019 expectations are, and the player chooses his imposter\u2019s reactions accordingly. This Knack does not provide a supernatural disguise that would fool someone with the Unfailing Recognition Knack (from Scion: Hero, p. 134), but even if such a Scion can see through the imposter\u2019s disguise, his recognition alone would not be enough to convince anyone else. The imposter retains the wherewithal to stand up to any impromptu interrogation and maintain his charade in everyone else\u2019s eyes, thus making the only other Scion who knows the imposter\u2019s true identity look like a horse\u2019s ass or a liar.",

            "Dice Pool: Stamina + Animal Ken \nCost: 1 Willpower + 1 Legend \nSome shamans believe that consuming a creature grants a measure of its strength. Scions who engage in this practice learn to absorb the capabilities of an animal by devouring such a creature and drawing forth its essence from the digested flesh. The Scion must eat a piece of meat from the appropriate animal (a potentially risky act, considering that the animal is probably considered sacred to his patron God). Then, the player expends the Willpower and Legend and rolls (Stamina + Animal Ken). The successes scored indicate the number of points of Abilities that the Scion may borrow from the animal. A Scion can only borrow Abilities up to the level possessed by the animal, although these dots can add on to his existing skill dots to a maximum total of five. Skills gained with Faunaphagia remain for the rest of the scene."

Her player then rolls (Wits + Command) and spends a Willpower point. If the roll succeeds, the Scion ties together the physical health of as many people who are present as possible. That is, if one person in the group suffers any damage, everyone included in the effect suffers the same pain and damage. For the base cost, she can tie the health of two people together. She can include one extra person beyond that for every extra Legend point she spends at the same time. The effect lasts for a maximum number of days equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend."
