A success on a (Strength + Presence) roll activates this Boon, and the Scion spends a set number of points of Legend (the maximum that may be spent is the value of the Scion\u2019s permanent Legend). The Boon then inflicts a DV penalty on his close-combat opponents equal to the number of Legend points he spent. This effect lasts for the rest of the combat scene."

For the rest of the Scene, the item has all of the supernatural properties of silver. While silver does not have any inherent special qualities for most Scions, it can be effective as a weapon against certain theriamorphs (were-creatures) and undead. Silver also features prominently in some kinds of magic. An item affected by Silver Blessing loses none of its native properties, but gains all the benefits of pure silver for the rest of the scene."

He must spend one Legend per person he wants to affect, up to a maximum number equal to his Legend. Affected victims suffer the Virtue Extremity from one of the Scion\u2019s chosen Virtues. If the Scion spends one additional Legend point per person, each person suffers an additional Virtue Extremity. That is, if he wants to affect five people with one Virtue Extremity, he must spend only five Legend points. If he wants them to suffer two Virtue Extremities, he must spend 10 Legend points. If he wants to affect all five people with the Virtue Extremity from all four of his Virtues, he must spend 20 Legend points. The Scion can choose how many of the present targets he wishes to affect, but he must affect them all with the same number of Virtue Extremities."
