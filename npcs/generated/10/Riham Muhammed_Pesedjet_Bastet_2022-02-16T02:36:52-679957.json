She can recognize their voices despite electronic distortion or overpowering background noise. She knows their scents and their body language and even the exact feel of the way they shake hands. She can also recognize an imposter when someone tries to mimic the voice or appearance of someone to whom she is Fatebound. Recognizing others is not quite as easy. If, when a Scion encounters a character to whom she is not Fatebound, she makes a concerted effort to try to remember that character\u2019s looks and mannerisms, the player may spend a point of Willpower to lock that image in the Scion\u2019s mind. After that, she retains the ability to recognize him despite all obfuscation for the rest of the story as if they two were Fatebound. Thereafter, the Scion loses any supernatural ability she had to recognize that character. (She doesn\u2019t forget what the character looks like, mind you. It\u2019s just that the Knack no longer applies to that person.) The timing of when the Scion recognizes a person is entirely up to the Storyteller as dictated by the needs of the story. If the private investigator who\u2019s been dogging the Scion\u2019s heels tries to slink up to the character in disguise at a crowded charity fund-raiser, the Scion might see the gumshoe coming a mile away (even despite the fake beard, the fat suit, the spray-on tan and the sex change). If a Scion of Loki who\u2019s a rival to a player\u2019s Scion of Anubis arrives in disguise to deliver a cryptic warning, the Scion of Anubis might not recognize her old foe until the trickster disappears with a wink behind the elevator\u2019s closing doors. Finally, as a side effect of this Knack, a Scion can always recognize when someone who is not in disguise is biologically related to a person she knows well (regardless of whether that person is Fatebound to her). She cannot intuitively grasp what that relationship is, but she knows it\u2019s there\u2014even if the person in question doesn\u2019t.",

                "Prerequisite Knack: Trick Shooter (Scion: Hero, p. 128) When fighting against fearsome titanspawn with armored hides, scaly skin or chitinous shells, sometimes a Scion has to aim for a very precise spot. Indeed, it was just such a weak spot that was the downfall of Achilles. Naturally, that sort of precision can be hard to achieve in the heat of battle, especially against a target with a supernaturally impressive defense. With the steady aim provided by Shot to the Heart, though, a Scion never needs to worry about hitting a small patch of exposed flesh, a vulnerable tendon or an eye between blinks \u2014 his attacks excel at finding the weak point. While Shot to the Heart is active, the Scion reduces any penalty for attacking a specific weak point by an amount up to his Epic Dexterity score. That is, if a giant turtle-like titanspawn has a weak spot in its soft underbelly, but striking the unarmored area has a difficulty of 5 and the attacking Scion has an Epic Dexterity of 3, then the Scion reduces the difficulty of making such a targeted shot to difficulty 2. Shot to the Heart can\u2019t reduce the added difficulty of a targeted shot to less than zero \u2014 making an attack on a vital spot is never easier than just hitting the damn thing. Also, Shot to the Heart doesn\u2019t give the Scion any innate knowledge of where a vital spot might be; it just lets him target the spot more effectively if he knows where to find one. While Shot to the Heart requires a Knack typically used with ranged combat as a prerequisite, this Knack can be used with any of the Scion\u2019s attacks. Activating this Knack costs three points of Legend. Its effects last for one scene.",

The Scion gains a number of Legend points equal to the number of successes rolled. The story must pertain specifically to the Scion, which the context should make clear. Also, it must be uttered or written without the Scion\u2019s direct knowledge. He might reasonably expect to see or hear it, but he cannot literally command someone to say or write it so as to reap the benefits. This Boon pertains only to evidence that his legend is spreading\u2014hence the Legend-point reward."

In response, a silver chariot descends, pulled by two black horses with manes, hooves and eyes of pure moonlight."

Each health level inflicted requires its own bandage, and the God must spend two Legend points when each is applied. Once every wound is wrapped, the God lies in state for one full day, bleeding his ichor into the bandages. After 24 hours, the bandages are removed and preserved in canopic jars decorated with the God\u2019s likeness. (The God must then heal the damage naturally, without using or receiving any supernatural healing.)"

When he does so, a cartouche seal bearing the hieroglyphic characters that represent his divine parent appears on the surface. This seal has an area in square inches equal to the successes acquired on the activation roll. (You can assume the seal is a rectangle to make determining its size easier.) Unless the surface that the seal covers is physically broken, the seal remains in place for a number of months equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. After that, it fades out as if it were never there."

This halo perfectly resembles the halo of sunfire that is visible around the edges of the moon during a total solar eclipse. The halo remains perpendicular to all witnesses\u2019 lines of sight simultaneously."

To be more specific, it grants a God the mental wherewithal to understand someone\u2019s True Name fully enough to be able to use it to compel that person. A True Name is more than just the sound a person makes to identify someone, it is the discrete, unique expression that sums up someone\u2019s very soul. A person is his True Name, and vice versa.

After spending the appropriate Legend and Willpower, the Scion\u2019s player rolls (Manipulation + Empathy) against the target\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). If the player invoking Mirror of Lunacy scores more successes, then the Boon takes hold: The targeted Scion sees himself in the reflection and suddenly realizes the extent of his madness. This causes the subject to immediately snap out of his Virtue extremity, although it does not necessarily prevent him from taking other rash actions in order to \u201cset right\u201d any mistakes that he may have made during that time. The Scion cannot use this Boon on herself, and it can be used only once per story."
