Indeed, it was just such a weak spot that was the downfall of Achilles. Naturally, that sort of precision can be hard to achieve in the heat of battle, especially against a target with a supernaturally impressive defense. With the steady aim provided by Shot to the Heart, though, a Scion never needs to worry about hitting a small patch of exposed flesh, a vulnerable tendon or an eye between blinks \u2014 his attacks excel at finding the weak point. While Shot to the Heart is active, the Scion reduces any penalty for attacking a specific weak point by an amount up to his Epic Dexterity score. That is, if a giant turtle-like titanspawn has a weak spot in its soft underbelly, but striking the unarmored area has a difficulty of 5 and the attacking Scion has an Epic Dexterity of 3, then the Scion reduces the difficulty of making such a targeted shot to difficulty 2. Shot to the Heart can\u2019t reduce the added difficulty of a targeted shot to less than zero \u2014 making an attack on a vital spot is never easier than just hitting the damn thing. Also, Shot to the Heart doesn\u2019t give the Scion any innate knowledge of where a vital spot might be; it just lets him target the spot more effectively if he knows where to find one.

            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Integrity \nCost: 1 Willpower + 5 Legend \nThe Amesha Spenta are six principles that represent aspects of the old Persian understanding of the World. For each level of this Boon, the Scion selects an additional Amesha Spenta. \nA mystic aura surrounds a Scion who invokes an Amesha Spenta. The Scion gains a benefit to one of her purviews. If the Scion currently lacks a suitable Birthright for channeling that purview, she can invoke the Boons she knows anyway, at no penalty. (She still needs to own a suitable Birthright and learn Boons as normal: Amesha Spenta Yasht merely offers a chance to channel the purview if the Birthright is unavailable.) If the Scion has her Birthright, then she gains bonus dice equal to her Legend on rolls to activate Boons from that purview. \nThe Scion may only invoke one aura per scene, but the Boon lasts for the remainder of the scene or until the Scion chooses to end it. \n\u2022 Ameretat \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Eternal Life. Associated with all plant life, this Amesha Spenta manifests as a faint shimmer of a green aura surrounding the Scion, twisting at the edges like a vine\u2019s tendrils. Ameretat is associated with the purview of Fertility. \n\u2022 Armaiti \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Holy Devotion. Armaiti is associated with the earth, and appears as a brown or beige aura around the Scion, crumbling at the edges into motes that fall and swirl back into the aura like a trickle of sand. Armaiti is associated with the purview of Earth. \n\u2022 Asha Vahishta \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Best Truth. A red-orange aura flares to life around the Scion, flickering at the edges like flames. Asha Vahishta is associated with the purview of Fire. \n\u2022 Haurvetat \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Perfect Wholeness. Associated with the waters of the world, this Amesha Spenta manifests as a light blue aura in constant motion, flowing smoothly across the Scion\u2019s features. Haurvetat is associated with the purview of Water. \n\u2022 Kshathra \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Righteous Dominion. Kshathra is associated with the sky and metals, and appears as a silver-white aura that flashes with angles and edges. Kshathra is associated with the purview of Sky. \n\u2022 Vohu Manah \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Good Wisdom. No aura appears, but the Scion\u2019s features take an ever-changing animalistic cast \u2014 her eyes might become cat-like one moment, or her skin may seem scaled the next. Vohu Manah is associated with the Animal purview."

            "Humata (Asha \u2022)",
            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1+ Legend \nUpon purchasing this Boon, the Scion chooses one of the three attribute categories (Mental, Social or Physical) to associate with this power. Thereafter, the Scion can invoke the principle of Humata (Good Thoughts) and call upon greater reserves of power. The Scion gains a single \u201cWild Card\u201d dot of Epic Attributes, which she may apply to any Attribute within her chosen category. This may raise an Epic Attribute beyond what the character\u2019s Legend rating allows. The character cannot use Humata multiple times to increase an Epic Attribute by more than one, or to increase any other Epic Attributes. Nor does the temporary dot of Epic Attribute grant an additional Knack. Humata (and its successor Boons) cannot raise an Epic Attribute above 10 dots. \nInvoking Humata costs as many Legend points as the final value of the chosen Epic Attibute. The effect lasts for a scene, and cannot be changed until the scene ends. \n Example: A Scion of Anahita has an Epic Intelligence of 2, no Epic Wits, a Legend of 3 and Humata associated with Mental Attributes. She could spends 3 points of Legend and increases her Epic Intelligence to 3, ignoring that her Legend is too low for that rating; or, she could spend 1 Legend to gain one dot of Epic Wits for the rest of the scene."
