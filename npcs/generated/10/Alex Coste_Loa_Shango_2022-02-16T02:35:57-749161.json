With just a flick of a finger, a jab of an elbow or a headbutt, the Scion delivers the entire force of her Epic Strength. Although this doesn\u2019t necessarily change the Scion\u2019s unarmed combat style \u2014 she still needs to land a strike on an enemy \u2014 it\u2019s quite intimidating when she can simply poke a building and cause an entire wall to crumble. Similarly, if the Scion is somehow restrained but able to move even a minuscule part of her body, she could (for instance) flick a tiny rock with her toe with enough force to kill a man. While this does not increase the Scion\u2019s damage output, it means that even when bound or restricted from moving in some way, the Scion can still bring all of her Epic Strength to bear in an attack. Perhaps she\u2019s chained with bindings made from Gleipnir and can\u2019t break them, but she can head-butt her assailant. Maybe she is buried in rock and can only move her little finger but can use that to send the boulder on the top of the heap flying. Her damage output and ability to lift are not impinged in any way when she\u2019s forced to rely only on a single limb, a part of her body or a restricted range of motion.

First, he can perform the eponymous action, surrounding himself with pure, breathable air. With five Legend, the God can breathe out 1,000 cubic yards of pure air per dot of Legend he has. (At the minimum, that\u2019s a sphere with a roughly 13-yard radius or a cube with roughly 21-yard sides.) This volume moves with the God, taking whatever shape he desires, and it remains breathable and clean for a number of hours equal to the successes on the activation roll. Using this Boon this way can also accomplish such feats as clearing an area of smoke or poisonous gas, creating a bubble of breathable air underwater or busting the seams on an airtight cell."
