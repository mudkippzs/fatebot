When he\u2019s in the presence of a Fated character whose role has been activated by proximity to someone to whom that Fated person is bound, he gets a tingle up the base of his neck.

                "Most Scions seem to stumble into Bands or find themselves guided into collaboration by their divine parents. A rare few, though, have the ability to smell (and sometimes hear) the very ichor that flows in the veins of other Scions. With just a sniff of the air, the Scion catches the signature scent that wafts off any Scion, marking the subject as more than mortal. The Scion automatically knows when she scents another Scion, be it hero, demigod or God. Indeed, her refined sense may even divulge the pantheon from which the other Scion hails, in the form of a specific flavor or memory that comes with the smell. Sometimes the triggered memory even brings with it the phantom sound of a particular music or tone. If a subject uses a Boon or Knack to conceal his identity or whereabouts, the sniffng Scion must first be able to locate the target. If she isn\u2019t aware of the other Scion\u2019s presence, then the sniffer won\u2019t smell anything. This power doesn\u2019t tell her that another Scion is lurking about somewhere, only that someone she\u2019s spotted is a Scion. Scions in general do not have individual, personalized scents of ichor, although at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion a God might be so powerful that his ichor is unique and distinct. Instead, a Scion\u2019s scent depends upon his parentage. Further, even though a Scion with this Knack might catch the scent of a particular pantheon, she might not recognize what it is until she\u2019s managed to encounter enough other Scions from said pantheon. If you have created other pantheons for use in your game, you\u2019ll want to decide on their scents as well. Note also that titanspawn do not have a signature scent that is discernable with this Knack. Activating this Knack costs one point of Legend."
