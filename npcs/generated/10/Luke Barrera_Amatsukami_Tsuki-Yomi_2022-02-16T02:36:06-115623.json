Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool.
