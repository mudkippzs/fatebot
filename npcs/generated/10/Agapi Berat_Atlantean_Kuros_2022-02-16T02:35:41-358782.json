First, he can perform the eponymous action, surrounding himself with pure, breathable air. With five Legend, the God can breathe out 1,000 cubic yards of pure air per dot of Legend he has. (At the minimum, that\u2019s a sphere with a roughly 13-yard radius or a cube with roughly 21-yard sides.) This volume moves with the God, taking whatever shape he desires, and it remains breathable and clean for a number of hours equal to the successes on the activation roll. Using this Boon this way can also accomplish such feats as clearing an area of smoke or poisonous gas, creating a bubble of breathable air underwater or busting the seams on an airtight cell."
