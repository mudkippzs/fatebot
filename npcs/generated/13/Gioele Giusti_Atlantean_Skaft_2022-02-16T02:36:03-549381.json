                "Prerequisite Knack: Opening Salvo It\u2019s pretty nice to be able to lay into someone with a witty bon mot and shake his faith in himself, as the prerequisite Knack allows. Yet, it\u2019s undeniably sweeter to let some pompous douchebag take the first swing and then utterly annihilate him with a cunning verbal riposte. To hit an attacker with a devastating comeback costs a single point of Legend. Doing so strips the victim of all of his spent Willpower points and doesn\u2019t allow him to recoup those lost points for one full day. A character can use this Knack to defend herself from a use of Opening Salvo if she has the Legend point to spend and her comeback is timely enough. A victim, however, can defend himself from a use of this Knack if he also uses this Knack. (He can retort without using the Knack, of course, but he still suffers the effect.) If two characters use this Knack in a verbal exchange, they can activate it once apiece and then trade insults until one scores a decisive hit over the other. If that victim\u2019s comeback is weaker than the one before it, he loses the impromptu contest and the Willpower points. As with Opening Salvo, the player must actually come up with a retort reasonably quickly. She doesn\u2019t have to be Hamlet running circles around Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, she just has to give it the old college try. Be warned, though: If you (the player) know you get tongue-tied when the heat is on and your Storyteller or fellow players are ruthless bastards, this Knack might not be the one for you.",

            "Dice Pool: Strength + Craft \nCost: 5 Legend, +1 Legend per Legend dot of the target \nA massive shard of crystal coalesces around the Scion\u2019s target. If the player\u2019s (Strength + Craft) roll bests the opponent\u2019s (Strength + Fortitude + Legend), then the opponent becomes encased in a clear, translucent, many-faceted shard of crystal. This prison holds the opponent in place but also renders it immune to physical attack. Unless something manages to penetrate the crystal, the occupant, in stasis, remains unaffected."

            "Dice Pool: Wits + Control \nCost: 5+ Legend \nA fire must burn, but when a God has this Boon, fire burns as he commands. To take control of the fire, the God need only stare into it and spend Legend points. When he does so, the fire becomes a three-dimensional mass that he can manipulate in all three dimensions in any way his imagination can conceive. For five Legend points, the God can manipulate 10 cubic yards of fire (based on its surface area and height). If less than 10 cubic yards of fire is present, the God can increase the present amount of fire to fill that volume. For each additional Legend point he spends, the God can increase the amount of fire under his control by 10 more cubic yards. (The God can spend no more additional points of Legend beyond the mandatory five than he has dots of Legend.) The God can move and shape fire under his control in all three dimensions\u2014lifting it off the ground entirely or making it take any three-dimensional shape he desires. He can even mold the fire into a recognizable shape and have it take actions."

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Willpower + 3 Legend \nUpon activating this Boon, the character\u2019s body immediately becomes a human-shaped pillar of white-hot flame. His features are unrecognizable except in silhouette (if he has a distinctive silhouette), and his voice has the quality of a roaring bonfire. In this form, the character\u2019s merest touch can set things alight or burn flesh. Touching the character inflicts a number of levels of lethal damage equal to his Legend. If the character physically attacks someone, the player adds that many extra levels of lethal damage to the results of his damage roll. The flames of the Scion\u2019s body can even burn a fellow Scion who has Fire Immunity (Fire 1) if that Scion\u2019s Legend is lower, though the lesser Scion suffers automatic fire damage equal to only the difference in their Legend ratings. The character\u2019s semisolid form also absorbs an amount of damage equal to the character\u2019s Legend from all physical attacks."

If he is near a pool or flow of it, he can walk on its surface without being burned, leaving a trail of stone footprints behind him. He can dive into the lava and swim through it as easily as water\u2014though he must use Echo Sounding to navigate beneath the surface. He can even cause tendrils of the red-hot liquid rock to rise from the surface and move at his mental command. He can control five cubic yards of lava per dot of Legend he has.
