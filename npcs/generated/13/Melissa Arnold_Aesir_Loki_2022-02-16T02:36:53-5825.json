This Knack expands the scope of the effect so that a character can hypnotize a whole group of people. The character\u2019s player rolls (Manipulation + Command + Legend) and spends a point of Legend and a point of Willpower. If the roll scores more successes than the average (Willpower + Legend) of the assembled audience, the character successfully implants the post-hypnotic suggestion in as many members of the audience as he has successes on the roll. Mortals cannot resist the effect or the compulsion to perform the implanted action. Characters with a Legend rating resist at the moment of hypnosis or at the moment the action is designated to take place, as with Instant Hypnosis.

                "Prerequisite Knack: Blurt It Out (Scion: Hero, p. 131) This Knack is similar to the Epic Charisma Knack called Borrowed Credibility (pp. 67-68) in that it allows a character to exert her Epic Attribute remotely through an agent or emissary. Doing so costs three Legend points and the player rolls her character\u2019s Manipulation-based dice pool. She then confers on a single emissary the results of that roll, including any bonus successes from Epic Manipulation, and instructs that emissary to try to convince someone of something important on her behalf. When the emissary goes to the intended person and tries to do as the Scion said, he uses the Scion\u2019s Manipulation roll instead of that of his own social roll. If the character actually wants the emissary to achieve the goal she tells the emissary to achieve, her player can simply roll the appropriate Manipulation-based dice pool and let her result substitute for what would be the emissary\u2019s roll of the same dice pool. Unlike with Borrowed Credibility, though, the character with this Knack can seed an effect in the emissary that is quite different from the one the emissary is instructed to use. In neither case does the emissary\u2019s player make the Manipulation-based roll himself. He simply says the words and lets the results of the conferred roll have their desired effect on the listener. The listener believes, however, that his decision is based solely on the emissary\u2019s efforts and remains unaware of the manipulator\u2019s influence. Character\u2019s with this Knack can use it on any willing character of lesser Legend\u2014though the character need not know or understand a contrary hidden intent.

                "After running into ambushes featuring no less than two dozen animated sand-golems with stone hearts, a Scion begins to wonder if there\u2019s some sort of pattern behind the attacks. The logical mind of a Scion with Epic Intelligence puts those patterns together and determines some viable conclusion. Once the sand-golems have been defeated, for instance, the Scion might theorize that since they are all made from sand, their creator must reside somewhere with a surfeit of sand \u2014 some desert. Normal people create theories like this all the time, but Scions with this Knack create theories that are correct. The Scion\u2019s player spends three points of Legend and rolls (Intelligence + appropriate Ability + Legend). The Ability used will depend upon the axiom in question: Deriving a scientific fact about something uses Science, while relying on observed clues to deduce a suspect uses Investigation. The Scion must then state the axiom clearly, such as \u201cI deduce from the presence of so much sand in these golems that the creator must reside within a desert,\u201d or \u201cThe constant attacks by ninja imply that our enemy must be related somehow to the Amatsukami.\u201d If the player\u2019s roll succeeds, the Storyteller will respond with \u201ctrue,\u201d meaning that the Scion\u2019s claim is known to be true; \u201cfalse,\u201d meaning that the claim is known to be false; or \u201cincorrect,\u201d meaning that the Scion has proceeded from a false assumption (perhaps forgetting that the ambushing ninja were all clones of Jean-Claude van Damme). If the Storyteller had already planned out that element of the adventure, then the player learns what the Storyteller had in mind by virtue of the power; if the Storyteller had left the element undecided, then his answer to the player\u2019s Axiom essentially enforces how that part of the story will unfold. The Scion logically knows exactly what to expect, and she knows immediately if her best guess is right, wrong, or founded on a mistake that she made. The difficulty of the roll depends upon the scope of the statement. Nailing down a simple fact, such as \u201cAll of these attackers use cheap guns, so their boss must be poor,\u201d has a low difficulty (1-5). Nailing down a more wide-ranging fact, such as \u201cDespite their varied forms, all of these titanspawn are all susceptible to silver, so we should prepare to use the powers of the Moon against them,\u201d has a moderate difficulty (6-15). Facts that affect the Overworld or Underworld, or that nail down specifics with exacting detail, are severely difficult (25+). The difference between a normal deduction and a fact nailed down with Axiom is that the Scion\u2019s stated fact (if confirmed by the Storyteller) is known to be right. Essentially, the Scion\u2019s player states something that will be true or will be false about the rest of the story. The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene.",

When he does so, the fire becomes a three-dimensional mass that he can manipulate in all three dimensions in any way his imagination can conceive. For five Legend points, the God can manipulate 10 cubic yards of fire (based on its surface area and height). If less than 10 cubic yards of fire is present, the God can increase the present amount of fire to fill that volume. For each additional Legend point he spends, the God can increase the amount of fire under his control by 10 more cubic yards. (The God can spend no more additional points of Legend beyond the mandatory five than he has dots of Legend.) The God can move and shape fire under his control in all three dimensions\u2014lifting it off the ground entirely or making it take any three-dimensional shape he desires. He can even mold the fire into a recognizable shape and have it take actions."

            "Dice Pool: Wits + Occult \nCost: (1 Willpower + 5 Legend) per bond \nA God with this Boon is slippery in the strands of Fate. If the God accrues a Fatebond in a scene, he activates this Boon and shuffles the coil of destiny onto another character. The person\u2014or people\u2014to whom the God would have been newly Fatebound are now Fatebound to the target character instead. After circumstances force the Storyteller to roll the God\u2019s Legend as a dice pool to determine Fatebinding, the God\u2019s player may roll (Wits + Occult). The difficulty is equal to the number of successes on the Legend roll, and that threshold must exceed the successes on a roll of (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) from the character onto whom he intends to shuck his Fatebonds. If the God has successes left over, the power works. He may then spend (one Willpower point and five Legend points) per Fatebond generated by the aforementioned Legend roll. Having done so, the God ducks the tightening bonds of Fate and sees the other character ensnared in them."
