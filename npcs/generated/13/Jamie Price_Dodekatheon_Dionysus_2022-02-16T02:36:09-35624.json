As a useful side effect, a Scion using this Knack has such great breath control that she can speak when underwater (or otherwise holding her breath) by releasing only a minimal amount of air. The character can easily manage short sentences and brief conversations. Extended speech, such as giving an academic lecture while underwater, is either too difficult or at least would drastically reduce the time the Scion can hold her breath (at the discretion of the Storyteller). This Knack also makes combat underwater much easier, since being struck or injured cannot cause the Scion to lose her breath unless someone makes a deliberate effort to squeeze the air from her lungs.",

            "Dice Pool: Stamina + Survival \nCost: 2 Legend per plant/patch \nThe Goddess touches a single plant and imbues its natural surroundings with her blessing. In so doing, she grants the plants of that area eternal life, regardless of environment or nutrition. Short of being set ablaze or physically torn apart, the affected plants grow to their full size in the normal time and remain alive and well thereafter. A Goddess can imbue eternal life into a single square mile of plant life per two Legend points her player spends\u2014up to a maximum number of square miles equal to the success her player makes on the (Stamina + Survival) activation roll. Once an area has been affected with this Boon, it remains in full bloom. Any small plant or piece of a larger plant that is broken or removed grows back within 24 hours."
