Whatever the written local, state and federal laws are in the community, he knows them all as they currently stand.

In America, for instance, federal laws remain the same regardless of what state you\u2019re in.

A rusted metal object loses durability and functionality. Its Hardness decreases to half normal, and if the object is a precision item (like a gun), it has a 50% chance to malfunction any time it\u2019s used. Restoring a rusted item to its original state wipes away all traces of age and even reverses the effects, so that a wholly rusted-out car body (for instance) would be as good as new.
