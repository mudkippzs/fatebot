                "Prerequisite Knack: Dreadful Mien (Scion: Hero, p. 133) The rotting flesh, slimy tentacles, flayed skin and protruding bones of various Gods are the divine way of saying \u201cDon\u2019t touch.\u201d Scions who truly exercise their creepiness become so repulsive that their enemies don\u2019t want to touch them or even look at them, even in battle. (People this ugly rarely have friends, anyway). To activate Do Not Want, the Scion\u2019s player expends three Legend points, then rolls (Appearance + Presence + Legend). Whenever someone first tries to attack or lay hands on the Scion, the aggressor\u2019s player must roll (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). If the attacker scores more successes than the Scion\u2019s player, his character\u2019s actions proceed as normal. If he scores fewer successes than the Scion, then the difference becomes a bonus to the Scion\u2019s DV against the attacker. This bonus persists for the rest of the scene. For example, if the Scion\u2019s player scores 6 successes on the (Appearance + Presence + Legend) roll and an attacker only manages to eke out 3 successes on his (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll, then the Scion gains a +3 bonus to DV against that attacker for the rest of the scene. This benefit applies against everyone who tries to take action against the Scion for the rest of the scene, though each attacker makes a separate resistance roll. (For the sake of sanity, the Storyteller might wish to roll once and apply a blanket penalty for large groups of extras.) Scions whose Epic Appearance represents divine beauty cannot use this Knack. Also, it doesn\u2019t work on ugly Scions with more dots of Epic Appearance than the one using the Knack.",

Unlike Serpent\u2019s Gaze, though, the Scion need not consciously maintain eye contact with her victim for the effect to endure. Once the victim has been trans\ufb01xed by the Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance, he remains thus until either the end of the scene or until the Scion leaves his line of sight. The victim will follow the Scion with his eyes, even turn in place if she wanders around the immediate area, but he can\u2019t do anything other than look at her. What\u2019s more, the Scion can capture a number of victims with her appearance equal to her (Epic Appearance + Legend) total. Her player only spends one point of Legend per person up to the maximum, and they all stop what they\u2019re doing to stare at her in rapt fascination. When the effect ends, they remember nothing that happened after the \ufb01rst moment they saw the Scion. Mortals and Scions of lesser or equal Legend are unable to look away on their own, but Scions with a greater Legend are not so vulnerable. After the Scion using the Knack takes one full action, the higher-Legend victim may spend a point of Willpower to negate the effect.

                "As Scions build up ever more dots of Epic Appearance, they grow ever more unearthly. As such, whether they\u2019re beautiful or quite the opposite, it becomes increasingly difficult to deal with mortal humans on their level. The Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance can\u2019t help but get in the way. This Knack, however, mitigates that factor. When the Scion\u2019s player spends a point of Willpower to activate it for the scene, any mortals who see the character completely ignore his Appearance score (both Epic and mundane). Witnesses might vaguely remember that a beautiful Scion was kind of pretty or that a disgustingly ugly Scion was dirty and a little scary, but that\u2019s it. They won\u2019t recognize the Scion again later unless the Scion uses this Knack in their presence again, and they won\u2019t be able to describe the Scion in great detail to anyone else. They might get height, hair color, skin tone, build and style of dress right, but details beyond those generalities prove elusive. Scions themselves are immune to this effect, as they are more than capable of dealing with the extremes that Epic Appearance represents. This Knack lasts for the scene, though the Scion can choose to turn off the effect before then. Also, while he\u2019s using this Knack to deal with a mortal, he cannot use any other Epic Appearance Knacks against him. Nor can he apply his Epic Appearance to rolls pertaining to dealing with that mortal at all until he lifts the effect.",

Spending a point of Legend and a point of Willpower, the Scion burns a mental vision of himself so deeply into the victim\u2019s mind that everyone the victim sees thereafter who\u2019s of the same sex as the Scion seems to be wearing the Scion\u2019s face.

Only the Scion\u2019s face stands out, sized and colored as appropriate for the person on hand, yet still undeniably the Scion\u2019s own. Shaking off this disorienting hallucination costs the victim a point of Willpower, but that doesn\u2019t end the effect. An hour later, the effect creeps back up on the victim until every person of the appropriate gender has the Scion\u2019s face again. Even worse, a character cannot regain spent Willpower points while he\u2019s languishing under this effect. The only hope for a mortal victim is that the Scion will track him down and decide to end the effect.

For three Legend points, the person ages one month in one day. For five Legend points, the person ages one year in one day. For seven Legend points, the person ages one decade in one day. The number of successes the player gets on the roll determines the number of days the Scion is able to make the victim age at the accelerated rate."

No amount of collapsing rubble can break the Scion\u2019s bones (or the Birthright itself), and he won\u2019t suffocate no matter how much dirt piles onto him. If he lacks the strength to free himself, however, he does run the risk of either starving to death or dying of thirst if no one digs him out. Yet, it would not be the earth that kills him, but his own lack of fortitude."

The Scion can move only through a volume of earth large enough to accommodate his entire body. Also, unless the Scion has Safely Interred (Earth \u2022), he can remain within the earth for only as long as he can hold his breath. If he stays under longer, he begins to drown.

This cloud swirls around him and accumulates on his body like a suit of plate armor plus helmet. Any earthen substance will suffice, from gravel to mud to sand. The armor the coating of particles creates has a bashing and lethal Hardness and soak equal to half the Scion\u2019s Legend (rounded up), as well as a mobility penalty equal to that of riot gear. It lasts for the rest of the scene, at the end of which it shatters into a million pieces and falls at the Scion\u2019s feet. A Scion with Shaping (Earth \u2022\u2022\u2022) can craft the armor into a stylized shape, but only if the Scion wearing the armor remains inactive long enough to allow it."

Characters of higher Legend than the singer are not affected. Those of equal Legend get to oppose the activation roll with a (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll. This soporific effect knocks out any living creature that can hear the Scion\u2019s voice, for a number of hours equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. Victims with no Legend rating remain asleep the whole time, never waking up regardless of what\u2019s going on around them. Characters with a Legend rating can be woken up by those who went unaffected, if the player of the character trying to rouse the sleeper makes more successes on an extended (Manipulation + Medicine) action to bring the sleeper around.

If he is near a pool or flow of it, he can walk on its surface without being burned, leaving a trail of stone footprints behind him. He can dive into the lava and swim through it as easily as water\u2014though he must use Echo Sounding to navigate beneath the surface. He can even cause tendrils of the red-hot liquid rock to rise from the surface and move at his mental command. He can control five cubic yards of lava per dot of Legend he has.

She then internalizes those characteristics, granting herself some of the features of a plant. While the Scion doesn\u2019t become completely suffused with plant-like characteristics, she does develop a noticeable greenish tint to her skin and hair. Her flesh becomes woody and slightly tough, which grants her one extra level of soak against lethal and bashing damage. She also gains the ability to draw sustenance by photosynthesis. So long as she garners at least four hours of sunlight in a day, she obviates her need for food completely. (While her body might still require a few trace elements, they are so negligible as to be ignored). Lastly, her blood becomes thick and sticky, completely mitigating any bleeding that might happen as a result of wounds; her injuries cover over in a translucent amber almost immediately.

As long as she doesn\u2019t move or otherwise draw attention to herself, mundane attempts to find or track her fail automatically. A mortal hunter with a trusty hound could walk right over the Scion\u2019s disguised back and never know she was there. Hunters of supernatural prowess fare only a little better. Those with the Epic Perception Knack Predatory Focus or a Survival Arete can attempt to track the hidden Scion\u2019s movements, their players rolling (Perception + Survival) against the hiding Scion\u2019s activation roll. Even if they get more successes than the Scion\u2019s player did, though, the hunters find only the general area in which the Scion is hiding. (They come to an area within a number of yards equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend but lose track of her unless she moves again.)

He can hollow out a depression suitable for the site of a mass grave or raise an earthen wall to keep hooligans at bay.
