The Scion must spend at least a minute lecturing to a crowd on a particular topic. The Scion\u2019s player then spends two points of Legend and rolls (Charisma + Presence + Legend). For each success scored, one person in the crowd gains temporary use of a Scion\u2019s Ability score. The Scion can perform this quick instruction for any one Ability, but everyone in the crowd hears the same speech and therefore can potentially benefit from the same Ability. For the rest of the scene, those affected by this power may choose to use the Scion\u2019s Ability in place of their own. Heroes can only allow a beneficiary to gain a maximum of three temporary dots in an Ability this way. Demigods can grant up to four dots, while Gods can grant up to five. Such a trick is very useful for turning a disorganized mob into deadly streetfighters (Brawl), creating a temporary squad of EMTs to deal with a disaster (Medicine) or getting the help of a group of inexperienced people in a large construction project, like the pyramids (Craft).

            "Dice Pool: Manipulation + Occult \nCost: 3 Legend (+ 1 Willpower) \nThe Scion recites certain prayers backward and fills a small enclosure with a cloying pall of incense smoke. Having done so, she may then place another Scion\u2019s stolen Birthright relic into the smoky enclosure, bind it with prayer strips decorated with mirror-reversed kanji and leave it there for 24 hours. When she removes the relic, she finds its kami disoriented and confused, unsure of where it is or who has possession of it. The Scion\u2019s player then makes a (Manipulation + Occult) roll for the character to convince the disoriented spirit that it has been recovered by its rightful master. If the roll succeeds, the relic functions for the Scion who\u2019s taken possession of it just as it normally does for the Scion for whom it was originally intended. That is, the Scion thief can make full use of the Boons normally accessed through it without her player having to make the Legend roll described in regards to Stolen Relics. The relic\u2019s kami remains disoriented and helpful for a number of days equal to the successes rolled to confuse it, at which point it comes to its senses and realizes how it\u2019s been tricked."

His voice becomes an unidentifiable whisper. The Scion can see through this mask, and other Scions using Night Eyes can recognize him through it. The shadow mask lasts for a maximum of 24 hours. The Scion can will it to disperse before that period elapses, but otherwise, it remains in place the whole time even if the Scion is unconscious.
