Thoughts of the Scion creep into the victim\u2019s mind unbidden either to undermine his concentration or to uplift his spirit. A beautiful Scion can use her Epic Appearance to make a character feel good about himself, granting him an extra Willpower point (which may exceed the character\u2019s maximum) and an extra die on any Art, Athletics, Command, Craft or Integrity dice pools. A hideous Scion in\ufb02icts quite the opposite effect. The fear she instills robs her victim of a Willpower point that he cannot regain until the effect wears off. The Scion also unsettles him so deeply that he loses one die from all Academics, Awareness, Control, Politics or Presence dice pools. Using this Knack costs the Scion a single point of Legend, and its effects last for 24 hours.

Characters of lesser Legend are unable to break the Scion\u2019s gaze on their own, but those with an equal or greater Legend are not so vulnerable.

With In Your Dreams, the Scion generally doesn\u2019t see anything (since most people don\u2019t sleep with their eyes open), but she retains everything that she hears, feels, tastes and smells while asleep. When she awakens, she can access her memories of all that happened around her, just as if she had been lying there feigning slumber. This is greatly enhanced if she also has the Perfect Memory Epic Intelligence Knack (Scion: Hero, pp. 135-136). Activating this Knack costs one point of Legend.

Once a Scion chooses this Knack, she can shift her Epic Appearance from hideous to beautiful at will. The player simply expends the requisite Legend cost and the Scion\u2019s mien transforms. In either form, she is still recognizable as herself; she cannot use this Knack to change her appearance, unless she also has a Knack like Detail Variation from p. 71 of Scion: God. However, she can change from an elegant, refined woman to a vengeful, nerve-wracking hag in the blink of an eye. Once she transforms thus, her range of available Epic Appearance Knacks shifts as appropriate. While beautiful, then, the Scion can invoke all of her known Epic Appearance Knacks that rely on great beauty; while hideous, she can invoke any of her Epic Appearance Knacks that require a monstrous countenance. Once a Scion learns this Knack, she can freely purchase any Epic Appearance Knack that would normally require incredible beauty or incredible monstrosity. She can only use the Knacks appropriate to the form that she currently bears, though. Activating this Knack costs three points of Legend. The Scion remains in her switched state until she decides to activate the Knack again.

While the character does so, he cannot see, hear or smell anything that\u2019s happening around his body.

A rare few, though, have the ability to smell (and sometimes hear) the very ichor that flows in the veins of other Scions. With just a sniff of the air, the Scion catches the signature scent that wafts off any Scion, marking the subject as more than mortal. The Scion automatically knows when she scents another Scion, be it hero, demigod or God. Indeed, her refined sense may even divulge the pantheon from which the other Scion hails, in the form of a specific flavor or memory that comes with the smell. Sometimes the triggered memory even brings with it the phantom sound of a particular music or tone. If a subject uses a Boon or Knack to conceal his identity or whereabouts, the sniffng Scion must first be able to locate the target. If she isn\u2019t aware of the other Scion\u2019s presence, then the sniffer won\u2019t smell anything. This power doesn\u2019t tell her that another Scion is lurking about somewhere, only that someone she\u2019s spotted is a Scion. Scions in general do not have individual, personalized scents of ichor, although at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion a God might be so powerful that his ichor is unique and distinct.

Further, even though a Scion with this Knack might catch the scent of a particular pantheon, she might not recognize what it is until she\u2019s managed to encounter enough other Scions from said pantheon.

If the Scion currently lacks a suitable Birthright for channeling that purview, she can invoke the Boons she knows anyway, at no penalty. (She still needs to own a suitable Birthright and learn Boons as normal: Amesha Spenta Yasht merely offers a chance to channel the purview if the Birthright is unavailable.) If the Scion has her Birthright, then she gains bonus dice equal to her Legend on rolls to activate Boons from that purview. \nThe Scion may only invoke one aura per scene, but the Boon lasts for the remainder of the scene or until the Scion chooses to end it. \n\u2022 Ameretat \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Eternal Life. Associated with all plant life, this Amesha Spenta manifests as a faint shimmer of a green aura surrounding the Scion, twisting at the edges like a vine\u2019s tendrils. Ameretat is associated with the purview of Fertility. \n\u2022 Armaiti \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Holy Devotion. Armaiti is associated with the earth, and appears as a brown or beige aura around the Scion, crumbling at the edges into motes that fall and swirl back into the aura like a trickle of sand. Armaiti is associated with the purview of Earth. \n\u2022 Asha Vahishta \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Best Truth. A red-orange aura flares to life around the Scion, flickering at the edges like flames. Asha Vahishta is associated with the purview of Fire. \n\u2022 Haurvetat \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Perfect Wholeness. Associated with the waters of the world, this Amesha Spenta manifests as a light blue aura in constant motion, flowing smoothly across the Scion\u2019s features. Haurvetat is associated with the purview of Water. \n\u2022 Kshathra \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Righteous Dominion. Kshathra is associated with the sky and metals, and appears as a silver-white aura that flashes with angles and edges. Kshathra is associated with the purview of Sky. \n\u2022 Vohu Manah \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Good Wisdom. No aura appears, but the Scion\u2019s features take an ever-changing animalistic cast \u2014 her eyes might become cat-like one moment, or her skin may seem scaled the next. Vohu Manah is associated with the Animal purview."

            "Dice Pool: (Perception + Empathy) \nCost: 5+ Legend (+ 1 Willpower) \nWhen a God has this Boon, his mind becomes a comprehensive legal database that maintains a complete list of the written laws of any society. He need only spend a single scene among the members of society, and the knowledge expands in his brain automatically (for no roll or point expenditure). Whatever the written local, state and federal laws are in the community, he knows them all as they currently stand. As long as he remains in the community, the God understands all its laws in all their minutiae. Dredging up a specific law for a community outside the one he\u2019s in requires a single Legend point if the law is not covered under the same greater legal umbrella as the community. In America, for instance, federal laws remain the same regardless of what state you\u2019re in. Understanding and being able to cite a US federal law costs no Legend as long as you\u2019re in America. Being able to automatically cite a specific penalty in the Georgia State Tax Code, however, would cost a single Legend point anywhere in the World or beyond except in the state of Georgia."

            "Dice Pool: Integrity + Legend \nCost: 10 Legend \nWhen the Scion uses this Boon, one of her chosen Amesha Spentas manifests to assist her. The aura of the Amesha Spenta flows off her body to coalesce as an abstract humanoid figure formed of the physical principle of the Amesha Spenta (i.e., fire for Asha Vahishta, water for Haurvetat, etc.) \nThe Amesha Spenta has all the Scion\u2019s dice pools and can use all the Boons that the Scion knows from the relevant purview. It acts by the Scion\u2019s will, but takes its own actions. As an abstract concept given form, though, the mystic helper cannot do anything but move and use Boons. It also uses the Scion\u2019s Legend to power those Boons. No mundane force can harm an Amesha Spenta, but attacks backed by Epic Attributes, Arete, or other supernatural means deal damage as normal. The Amesha Spenta has soak equal to the Scion\u2019s natural soak (including Epic Stamina) and it has five \u20130 Health levels. \nThis Boon may be used once per scene. The Amesha Spenta lasts for one minute per success on the activation roll. \nThe Scion may also select a fifth Amesha Spenta to associate with Asha, as per the previous Boon."
