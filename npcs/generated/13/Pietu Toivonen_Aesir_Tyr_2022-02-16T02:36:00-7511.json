Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool.

Also, the character\u2019s instructions to her emissary cannot run counter to the effect of the Charisma-based roll she intends to bestow upon that emissary.

            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Presence \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion adopts some idealized warrior aspect, from howling berserker to unquestioning enlisted man to fearless officer to pitiless samurai. This attitude unnerves and intimidates any opponent who faces him in combat, inflicting a penalty equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend on any attack roll the opponent makes. This penalty applies to any character with a lesser or equal Legend rating who attempts to attack the Scion. This idealized aspect lasts for a number of consecutive actions during the battle equal to the successes the Scion\u2019s player rolled to activate it, and he can invoke it only once during any given battle."

He\u2019s half again as tall as he was originally and sheathed in powerful muscle. He gains eight free Attribute dots to be divided up between Strength and Stamina as the God wishes, as well as two dots each of Epic Strength and Epic Stamina. (Knack-selection is up to the player.) His Legend is 2, and he has imposed on him the following Virtue ratings: Courage 5, Endurance 3, Expression 1, Loyalty 5. This empowerment also adds eight -0 health levels to the mortal\u2019s original total. A Scion cannot use this Boon on a beast."

For a demigod, the usual way to do so is to blast right through them, a power epitomized by this Boon. When a demigod invokes the Siege Juggernaut Boon, she becomes capable of using her normal weapons (or even unarmed attacks) as artillery. To the onlooker, no change is visible until the Scion lashes out.
