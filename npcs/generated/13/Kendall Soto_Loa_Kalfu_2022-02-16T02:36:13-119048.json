Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool.

            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Larceny \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion pulls a shadow down from the brim of his hat or up from beneath his collar and wraps it around his head, rendering him completely unrecognizable to human eyes or electronic surveillance equipment (even equipment designed specifically to see in darkness). His voice becomes an unidentifiable whisper. The Scion can see through this mask, and other Scions using Night Eyes can recognize him through it. The shadow mask lasts for a maximum of 24 hours. The Scion can will it to disperse before that period elapses, but otherwise, it remains in place the whole time even if the Scion is unconscious. It doesn\u2019t disperse even if someone shines a bright light in the Scion\u2019s face."

If this roll succeeds, the God seems to pluck a palm-sized silvery moon disk out of the sky and either secrets it away down his sleeve or drops it into a bag or pocket.

He need only be able to see his victims in person as his player rolls (Wits + Medicine) and spends five Legend points. With the base activation, the God can affect a number of targets equal to his Legend. Each additional Legend point he spends adds another number of victims equal to his Legend. Each victim\u2019s player resists the God\u2019s player\u2019s single activation roll with a (Stamina + Fortitude) roll. If the God wins this contest, non-reflective blackness clouds the victims\u2019 eyes, and the victims go blind. For mortals and other characters with no Legend rating, this effect is permanent. For characters with a Legend rating lower than that of the God using this Boon, the effect lasts for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s threshold successes. For characters with a higher Legend rating, the effect lasts for a number of hours equal to the threshold successes."

When The Void passes over an area, men go mad\u2014tearing at each other\u2019s flesh, lining up in perfect fractal patterns, spelling out the secret names of the Titans in the blood of their loved ones or screaming until they die of exhaustion. The Void breaks down the physical structure of solid things it looks upon, reconstructing them into impossible configurations. Unprotected Gods can only stare in confusion as The Void passes. Titans turn against each other, rebuild what they have destroyed or become as cultured and refined as their divine offspring until their base natures reassert themselves."
