Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool.

            "Warrior Ideal",
            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Presence \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion adopts some idealized warrior aspect, from howling berserker to unquestioning enlisted man to fearless officer to pitiless samurai. This attitude unnerves and intimidates any opponent who faces him in combat, inflicting a penalty equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend on any attack roll the opponent makes. This penalty applies to any character with a lesser or equal Legend rating who attempts to attack the Scion. This idealized aspect lasts for a number of consecutive actions during the battle equal to the successes the Scion\u2019s player rolled to activate it, and he can invoke it only once during any given battle."

            "Unseen Shield",
            "Dice Pool: Stamina + Fortitude \nCost: 2 Legend + 1 Willpower \nThe Scion concentrates and projects an invisible, semi-spherical shield of pure force around herself and those she\u2019s trying to protect. The base of this shield can be as big as 500 square feet in area (about 13 feet in radius) per dot of Legend the character has, though she can keep it smaller. Ghosts, spirits and physical beings of lesser Legend than the Scion cannot penetrate this shield. If such a being has an equal or higher Legend rating (and can bring a physical force to bear), it can attempt to batter the shield apart with physical attacks. The shield can take a number of health levels of damage equal to [the Scion\u2019s (Legend x 5) + activation roll successes], and it has an all-purpose Hardness rating equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend."

Successes scored by the player on an (Intelligence + Science) roll determines the strength of the poison that can be created. Consult the accompanying table for its toxicity:"
