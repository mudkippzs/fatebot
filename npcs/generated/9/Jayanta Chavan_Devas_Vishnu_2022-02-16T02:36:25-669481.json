With In Your Dreams, the Scion generally doesn\u2019t see anything (since most people don\u2019t sleep with their eyes open), but she retains everything that she hears, feels, tastes and smells while asleep. When she awakens, she can access her memories of all that happened around her, just as if she had been lying there feigning slumber. This is greatly enhanced if she also has the Perfect Memory Epic Intelligence Knack (Scion: Hero, pp. 135-136). Activating this Knack costs one point of Legend.
