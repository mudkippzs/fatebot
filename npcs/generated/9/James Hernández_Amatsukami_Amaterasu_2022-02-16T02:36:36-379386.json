With just a flick of a finger, a jab of an elbow or a headbutt, the Scion delivers the entire force of her Epic Strength. Although this doesn\u2019t necessarily change the Scion\u2019s unarmed combat style \u2014 she still needs to land a strike on an enemy \u2014 it\u2019s quite intimidating when she can simply poke a building and cause an entire wall to crumble. Similarly, if the Scion is somehow restrained but able to move even a minuscule part of her body, she could (for instance) flick a tiny rock with her toe with enough force to kill a man. While this does not increase the Scion\u2019s damage output, it means that even when bound or restricted from moving in some way, the Scion can still bring all of her Epic Strength to bear in an attack. Perhaps she\u2019s chained with bindings made from Gleipnir and can\u2019t break them, but she can head-butt her assailant. Maybe she is buried in rock and can only move her little finger but can use that to send the boulder on the top of the heap flying.

So long as she garners at least four hours of sunlight in a day, she obviates her need for food completely. (While her body might still require a few trace elements, they are so negligible as to be ignored). Lastly, her blood becomes thick and sticky, completely mitigating any bleeding that might happen as a result of wounds; her injuries cover over in a translucent amber almost immediately. Greenskin lasts for a number of scenes equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend, or until the Scion chooses to cancel the effect."

            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Survival \nCost: 2 Legend \nThe Scion imagines a specific shape she wants the nearby plant life to take, and her will makes it so. On a successful (Intelligence + Survival) roll, the Scion affects a number of large plants (or a number of square yards of a patch of smaller plants) equal to the successes the roll achieved. Before her eyes, the plants bend as her imagination desires and set in the new arrangement\u2014 after which they continue to grow as normal. The Scion can\u2019t move the plants around fast enough or with enough finesse to attack people, but she can weave them into bindings or cages to hold people who aren\u2019t moving."

When the effect occurs, a broad band of sunfire arcs off her and dissipates slowly in the air. This arc, this solar prominence in miniature, disrupts all television, radio, cell phone, wi-fi, walkie-talkie, CB and satellite signals in the air around her for a number of yards equal to the player\u2019s successes on the roll. This disruption lasts for five seconds per dot of Legend the character has, and the area of effect moves with her."

That is, he tells it what to do, and the object does that very thing as if the God himself were using it. A car might drive itself. A sword might float in the air and fight the God\u2019s foes. A hairbrush might take the tangles out of his matted mane."
