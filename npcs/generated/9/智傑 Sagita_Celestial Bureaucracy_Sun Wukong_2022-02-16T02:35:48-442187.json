The Scion could use a wooden board to clobber a thug, or he could ram a flimsy iron fireplace poker right through a wall of concrete with the full force of his Epic Strength. In either case, the tool would remain reasonably intact (albeit with some cosmetic wear). Such guarantees are particularly handy when using an object of questionable strength to beat a titanspawn to death without destroying the item in question (such as a snow globe intended as a present). Note that Titanium Tools doesn\u2019t improve the Hardness or rigidity of an item. A cheap katana can still be snapped in half by an angry titanspawn that decides to target the blade. A limp spaghetti noodle is no better a weapon with this Knack than without.

While this does not increase the Scion\u2019s damage output, it means that even when bound or restricted from moving in some way, the Scion can still bring all of her Epic Strength to bear in an attack. Perhaps she\u2019s chained with bindings made from Gleipnir and can\u2019t break them, but she can head-butt her assailant.

For the rest of the scene, anyone who enters that intersection becomes unable to determine direction. Compasses wildly spin, GPS locators lose their signal and landmarks shift and can\u2019t be pinned down. The Chaos-user remains able to navigate, but anyone else who isn\u2019t touching the invoking Scion becomes completely turned around. When a traveler passes through the area, no matter what precautions he takes, he becomes disoriented and exits in a random direction."

Such animals are as loyal to him as those granted by the Creatures Birthright, and he can automatically command them mentally. They follow any command the Scion gives them to the best of their ability, and they last for one scene before dissolving into nothingness once again. To grant the creatures solidity, the Scion must pay a number of Legend points relative to the creature\u2019s size. Doing so allows him to create a number of units of the creature per Legend point spent, as follows:"

At will, the character can transform a ghost into a lesser immortal with a maximum Legend of 4. This can be a demon, an Earth God, the Chinese analogues to nymphs or alfar \u2014 whatever the Scion wants. To perform this feat, the Scion walks in a circle around the ghost she intends to transform, placing her feet so her steps form stylized images of various groups of stars, a practice called \u201cpacing the constellations.\u201d The transformed ghost may feel some gratitude for his promotion to lesser immortal, and the exercise of Legend has the normal chance of Fatebinding, but the Boon does not intrinsically grant the Scion any control over the lesser immortal he just made."

If the activation roll succeeds, a riot breaks out. Five people per success on the roll immediately lose all sense of decorum and civility and start wrecking the joint. They work together en masse, to cause property damage and to chase down and attack hapless victims who don\u2019t go with the flow.
