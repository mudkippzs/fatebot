With this Knack, any tool or item that the Scion picks up benefits from the same bends and loopholes in the laws of physics that allow Epic Strength to defy both leverage and structural integrity. The Scion could use a wooden board to clobber a thug, or he could ram a flimsy iron fireplace poker right through a wall of concrete with the full force of his Epic Strength. In either case, the tool would remain reasonably intact (albeit with some cosmetic wear). Such guarantees are particularly handy when using an object of questionable strength to beat a titanspawn to death without destroying the item in question (such as a snow globe intended as a present). Note that Titanium Tools doesn\u2019t improve the Hardness or rigidity of an item. A cheap katana can still be snapped in half by an angry titanspawn that decides to target the blade.

Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool. He must claim the God\u2019s authority when he does so, speaking in the divine figure\u2019s holy name. Characters with this Knack can use it on any willing emissary of equal or lesser Legend.

Also, the character\u2019s instructions to her emissary cannot run counter to the effect of the Charisma-based roll she intends to bestow upon that emissary.

To do so, the Loa must take complete control of a mortal victim then cover his mouth with her own and take a long, deep breath (as with the Waking Zombie Boon [Cheval 5]). When she does so, not just the victim\u2019s spirit, but the victim\u2019s whole self disappears down the Loa\u2019s gullet and remains locked away inside her. The victim\u2019s player resists this effect with a (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll."

            "Dice Pool: Wits + Command \nCost: 1 Willpower + 1 Legend (+1 Legend per extra person) \nWhen the Scion is in the middle of a confrontation that she wants to see ended with as little bloodshed as possible, she calls out in a stentorian voice and does whatever she must to get everyone\u2019s attention. Her player then rolls (Wits + Command) and spends a Willpower point. If the roll succeeds, the Scion ties together the physical health of as many people who are present as possible. That is, if one person in the group suffers any damage, everyone included in the effect suffers the same pain and damage. For the base cost, she can tie the health of two people together. She can include one extra person beyond that for every extra Legend point she spends at the same time. The effect lasts for a maximum number of days equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend."

To use it, she accuses the guilty party of the injustice (be it in person, in a letter, over the phone, via skywriting\u2026), and her player spends a point of Legend and rolls (Manipulation + Integrity). If the roll succeeds, the accusation causes the victim to periodically hallucinate like Macbeth or his wife. These hallucinations occur randomly, torturing the guilty party with the knowledge that justice hasn\u2019t been served. They also render him unable to regain Willpower."

            "Dice Pool: Wits + Marksmanship \nCost: 3 Legend per attack \nThis Boon calls upon the power of lightning, either from the sky or from the Scion himself. To use it, the Scion raises a hand heavenward or points his Birthright weapon at his intended foe. At his behest, lightning either lances down from the sky or launches from the weapon itself to smite the victim. Each such bolt inflicts 15 dice of lethal damage plus extra successes on the Marksmanship roll. An attack that inflicts damage also inflicts knockdown or knockback automatically."
