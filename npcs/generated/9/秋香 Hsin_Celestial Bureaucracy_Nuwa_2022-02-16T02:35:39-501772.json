If the roll succeeds, the Scion can tell what crimes were committed at that scene (if it was more than one), how many perpetrators were involved, how long ago it happened, roughly the sequence of events that took place and what means the perpetrators employed to cover up evidence. The dif\ufb01culty of the roll should re\ufb02ect how long ago the crime occurred, how contaminated the crime scene has been since then and how thorough the criminals were in covering their tracks. This Knack doesn\u2019t reveal speci\ufb01c, plot-sensitive information that isn\u2019t readily apparent (such as who the perpetrators actually are), but it should provide enough clues in a single glance for the character to develop solid leads that further the story.",

To gain the Legend, the Scion must down the drink quickly and with at least a bit of flair. Nursing a beer for an hour isn\u2019t worth Legend, though downing a pint of ale in one long pull and slamming the tankard down on the bar might be. Effectively, the character must turn drinking into a stunt performed for no purpose except to impress onlookers. This Knack does not protect the Scion from the normal effects of consuming alcohol, including any drugs or poisons the beverage might contain. In fact, activating this Knack bars a Scion from using his Epic Stamina to resist intoxication. Only normal Stamina applies. Also, characters cannot double-dip for Legend by taking a drink as part of a stunt performed for some other purpose (such a draining a mug of beer then throwing the mug at an enemy\u2019s head as a distraction before an attack).",

For the most part, this Knack plays itself out without resorting to dice rolls or trait comparisons.

For the rest of the Scene, the item has all of the supernatural properties of silver. While silver does not have any inherent special qualities for most Scions, it can be effective as a weapon against certain theriamorphs (were-creatures) and undead. Silver also features prominently in some kinds of magic. An item affected by Silver Blessing loses none of its native properties, but gains all the benefits of pure silver for the rest of the scene."

            "Dice Pool: Manipulation + Presence \nCost: 1 Legend per Virtue Extremity and per person \nThe Scion captures the attention of a group of people and drives them temporarily mad. He must spend one Legend per person he wants to affect, up to a maximum number equal to his Legend. Affected victims suffer the Virtue Extremity from one of the Scion\u2019s chosen Virtues. If the Scion spends one additional Legend point per person, each person suffers an additional Virtue Extremity. That is, if he wants to affect five people with one Virtue Extremity, he must spend only five Legend points. If he wants them to suffer two Virtue Extremities, he must spend 10 Legend points. If he wants to affect all five people with the Virtue Extremity from all four of his Virtues, he must spend 20 Legend points. The Scion can choose how many of the present targets he wishes to affect, but he must affect them all with the same number of Virtue Extremities."

            "Dice Pool: Stamina + Survival \nCost: 3 Legend \nWith a blessing, the Scion protects a patch of land from all natural blights and vermin infestations for one year. Alternatively, she can curse the land with a blight that either kills the plants within it outright or makes them so attractive to vermin that the resulting infestation has the same effect. The Scion\u2019s player spends three Legend and rolls (Stamina + Survival). The number of successes she rolls determines how many acres she can affect with this power. If one Scion wants to use an aspect of this Boon on a patch of land on which another Scion has used the opposite aspect, a contested roll is called for. Whoever achieves more successes spreads her effect over the larger area, canceling out the lesser effect."

Over the course of several ticks, the target drowns on this viscous internal flood until it either fights off the demigod\u2019s power or collapses in a heap."
