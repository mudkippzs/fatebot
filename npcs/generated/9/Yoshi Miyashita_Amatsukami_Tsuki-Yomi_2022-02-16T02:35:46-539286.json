For the rest of the Scene, the item has all of the supernatural properties of silver. While silver does not have any inherent special qualities for most Scions, it can be effective as a weapon against certain theriamorphs (were-creatures) and undead. Silver also features prominently in some kinds of magic. An item affected by Silver Blessing loses none of its native properties, but gains all the benefits of pure silver for the rest of the scene."

The spirit\u2019s face materializes in the shrine, and the Scion may attempt to use any Tsukumo-Gami Boons she possesses on it, just as if she were in the being\u2019s physical presence. The kami can also cause to materialize above the shrine an image of what\u2019s happening at the kami\u2019s physical location, allowing the Scion to remotely witness that location as the kami sees and hears it. This contact lasts for a maximum number of minutes equal to the successes on the activation roll. The kami can break off contact as well if the Scion offends it."

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend \nBy looking up at the moon and spending the requisite Legend point, the character sees reflected in it a bird\u2019s-eye view of the surrounding terrain. This perspective allows a clear view of a radius in miles equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. The Scion may focus on any point in the reflection and see it clearly, but he can\u2019t see through physical objects or change the angle from the top-down perspective. This Boon doesn\u2019t function on new moon nights, but it can see down through thick clouds on any other night. If the moon is visible during the day, the Scion can use this Boon then as well."
