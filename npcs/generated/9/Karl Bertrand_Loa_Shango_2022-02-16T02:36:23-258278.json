                "Prerequisite Knack: Holy Bound (Scion: Hero, p. 126) A character with this Knack cannot necessarily fly, but the difference between using this Knack and flying is a subtlety that is easily lost on mortal onlookers. For the cost of 10 Legend points, this Knack converts the distance increment a character can jump from yards to hundreds of yards. That is, the character can leap the distance of one football field straight up for every dot of (Strength + Athletics) she has plus the bonus number granted by her Epic Strength. She can jump twice that length horizontally. At Strength 12, Athletics 5 and Epic Strength 10 (plus accounting for this Knack\u2019s prerequisite), the character can leap a little bit more than seven miles straight up \u2014 which is about one and a half miles higher than the peak of Mount Everest \u2014 or more than 14 miles horizontally. Used in combat, this Knack makes jumping something more than a Speed 5 miscellaneous action. When a character takes a leap that can potentially carry her for miles, that action is typically narrated rather than played out tick by tick. If no one can fly after her, leap after her or run fast enough to keep up with her, the character effectively leaves combat. In \u201cflight,\u201d the character retains her full DVs and attack dice pools. This Knack also makes jumping more dangerous than it normally is. Normally, a character can always safely fall from the maximum height to which she can normally jump. This Knack, however, overrides that safety standard by extending a person\u2019s jumping height to preposterous extremes. If a character who uses this Knack to leap aeronautically is successfully attacked in flight and that attack inflicts enough damage to cause knockdown or knockback, the character\u2019s prodigious leap turns into an uncontrolled fall. The player gets one chance per dot of Epic Strength the character has to succeed on a (Dexterity + Athletics) roll. If she does succeed, the character retains her aerial poise and lands, if not gracefully, at least safely. If the roll fails, the character suffers damage relevant to falling from a great height.",

He can lift the heaviest weights with one hand while using his other hand to cover a yawn. He can throw a spear into orbit with a flick of his finger.

With Mind-Riding, however, the Scion can listen in on the thoughts of the person whose senses she\u2019s riding. These thoughts whisper in the rider\u2019s mind, and the mental images they conjure play behind the rider\u2019s eyes. Yet, while the rider has access to her victim\u2019s conscious thoughts, she garners only what context those thoughts provide. She can\u2019t snoop around in the victim\u2019s memory to make sense of an enigmatic reaction. While using Rada\u2019s Eyes, the Scion need only spend an additional point of Legend in order to listen in on the host\u2019s thoughts."

The Scion need not be using Rada\u2019s Eyes (Cheval 1) first in order to use this Boon, but all of the victims must be in the Scion\u2019s line of sight when she activates it. The player makes one activation roll and compares the results to the (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) rolls of all the victims. Any victim her roll beats becomes a spirit horse for her, up to a maximum number equal to her Legend. She can maintain this multiple possession for one scene, and her real body slumps insensate as per Horse."

By meditating on the item and relaxing her own perceptions\u2014as well as spending a point of Legend after a successful (Perception + Empathy) roll on the part of her player\u2014the Scion experiences the victim\u2019s perceptions clearly and distinctly.
