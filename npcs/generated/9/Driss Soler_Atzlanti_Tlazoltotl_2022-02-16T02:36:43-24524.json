Doing the former involves talking the victim through some genuine memory and \u201ccorrecting\u201d details as they come out. Creating a false memory from whole cloth is simply a matter of the character describing the \u201cremembered\u201d events to the victim and telling her when and where those events occurred. False or altered memories replace the originals in the victim\u2019s mind, erasing what was in their place originally. The cost, dice pool, restrictions and resistance mechanics of this Knack are the same as for Instant Hypnosis. If the victim is mortal (or another type of extra), she won\u2019t ever accept that her new memories are false. She might think she was on drugs at the time or was hallucinating with fever, but she clings to the belief that the memory is genuine. Characters with a Legend rating will assume as mortals do unless they are confronted with evidence to suggest the memories are false. Even then, however, they still cannot get their original memories back.",

As such, whether they\u2019re beautiful or quite the opposite, it becomes increasingly difficult to deal with mortal humans on their level. The Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance can\u2019t help but get in the way. This Knack, however, mitigates that factor.

Witnesses might vaguely remember that a beautiful Scion was kind of pretty or that a disgustingly ugly Scion was dirty and a little scary, but that\u2019s it.

Scions themselves are immune to this effect, as they are more than capable of dealing with the extremes that Epic Appearance represents. This Knack lasts for the scene, though the Scion can choose to turn off the effect before then.

The player spends Legend equal to the cost of the power being countered plus one (plus an additional three Legend for every point of Willpower spent on the power being countered), then rolls (Manipulation + Presence + Legend). If the player rolls more successes than the original command, the subject immediately snaps out of it and realizes that he didn\u2019t want to do whatever it is that he was compelled to do. If the original power didn\u2019t require a roll to succeed (like Overt Order), then the Scion\u2019s player must simply score a number of successes equal to the original commander\u2019s (Manipulation + Command + Legend). In order to countermand a specific Epic Charisma or Epic Manipulation Knack, the Scion using Deprogramming must also know the Knack being used.

Characters of lesser Legend are unable to break the Scion\u2019s gaze on their own, but those with an equal or greater Legend are not so vulnerable.

If he\u2019s looking for something specific in the earth\u2014such as gold, oil or a human body\u2014this Boon reveals its distance from him and depth from the epicenter at the expense of the other information. The Boon works only at ground level or on the up-thrust surface of a mountainside, but it works through floors and pavement. It gives the Scion a semispherical reading with a radius equal to one half mile per dot of Legend."

If the player\u2019s (Strength + Craft) roll bests the opponent\u2019s (Strength + Fortitude + Legend), then the opponent becomes encased in a clear, translucent, many-faceted shard of crystal.

This cloud swirls around him and accumulates on his body like a suit of plate armor plus helmet. Any earthen substance will suffice, from gravel to mud to sand. The armor the coating of particles creates has a bashing and lethal Hardness and soak equal to half the Scion\u2019s Legend (rounded up), as well as a mobility penalty equal to that of riot gear. It lasts for the rest of the scene, at the end of which it shatters into a million pieces and falls at the Scion\u2019s feet. A Scion with Shaping (Earth \u2022\u2022\u2022) can craft the armor into a stylized shape, but only if the Scion wearing the armor remains inactive long enough to allow it."

With a successful (Dexterity + Craft) roll by his player, the Scion can shape it into any form his nimble fingers can produce. The Scion can affect up to one cubic foot of material at a time.

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 2 Legend \nWith a pass of the hand, the Scion causes a coating of rust or oxidization to form on a metallic object or conversely removes such a coating, restoring an item to its untarnished form. A rusted metal object loses durability and functionality. Its Hardness decreases to half normal, and if the object is a precision item (like a gun), it has a 50% chance to malfunction any time it\u2019s used. Restoring a rusted item to its original state wipes away all traces of age and even reverses the effects, so that a wholly rusted-out car body (for instance) would be as good as new. The rusted parts don\u2019t just disappear, they reverse the process and become solid metal again. Invoking this power on an item requires the Scion to physically touch or manipulate the object, and it has no effect on metals that don\u2019t rust (such as gold) or upon Relics."
