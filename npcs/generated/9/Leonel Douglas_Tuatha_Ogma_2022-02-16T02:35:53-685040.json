In either case, the tool would remain reasonably intact (albeit with some cosmetic wear). Such guarantees are particularly handy when using an object of questionable strength to beat a titanspawn to death without destroying the item in question (such as a snow globe intended as a present). Note that Titanium Tools doesn\u2019t improve the Hardness or rigidity of an item. A cheap katana can still be snapped in half by an angry titanspawn that decides to target the blade.

A Scion could keep a mine from caving in, hang from a noose for days or drag a chained beast slowly toward her, but she could not run, jump or perform most combat actions. A Scion is still limited by her normal and Epic Strength ratings, though she can perform feats at the top of her capabilities for days using this Knack.

The base of this shield can be as big as 500 square feet in area (about 13 feet in radius) per dot of Legend the character has, though she can keep it smaller. Ghosts, spirits and physical beings of lesser Legend than the Scion cannot penetrate this shield. If such a being has an equal or higher Legend rating (and can bring a physical force to bear), it can attempt to batter the shield apart with physical attacks. The shield can take a number of health levels of damage equal to [the Scion\u2019s (Legend x 5) + activation roll successes], and it has an all-purpose Hardness rating equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend."
