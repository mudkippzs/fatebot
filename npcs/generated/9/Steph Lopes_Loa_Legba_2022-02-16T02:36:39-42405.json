                "Prerequisite Knack: Blessing of Importance (Scion: Hero, p. 130) A heroic Scion with Epic Charisma can help restore a mortal\u2019s sense of self worth and empowerment just by paying a bit of attention to him and making him feel special. The charismatic Scion can even replenish a measure of the same for one of his fellow Scions. A demigod Scion\u2019s attention makes a person feel even more important, though, especially when the Scion goes out of his way to treat the person like a true friend. When the demigod does so (and spends a point of Legend), he completely re\ufb01 lls a fellow Scion\u2019s spent Willpower points (if that amount is higher than the charismatic Scion\u2019s Epic Charisma). Should he treat a mortal with such affection, the mortal not only regains all his spent Willpower, as per Blessing of Importance, he gains an extra dot of Willpower for the scene. When that extra dot goes away at the end of the scene, the mortal\u2019s spent Willpower completely replenishes again. The Scion can affect a person only once per scene with this Knack.",

                "Prerequisite Knack: Opening Salvo It\u2019s pretty nice to be able to lay into someone with a witty bon mot and shake his faith in himself, as the prerequisite Knack allows. Yet, it\u2019s undeniably sweeter to let some pompous douchebag take the first swing and then utterly annihilate him with a cunning verbal riposte. To hit an attacker with a devastating comeback costs a single point of Legend. Doing so strips the victim of all of his spent Willpower points and doesn\u2019t allow him to recoup those lost points for one full day. A character can use this Knack to defend herself from a use of Opening Salvo if she has the Legend point to spend and her comeback is timely enough. A victim, however, can defend himself from a use of this Knack if he also uses this Knack. (He can retort without using the Knack, of course, but he still suffers the effect.) If two characters use this Knack in a verbal exchange, they can activate it once apiece and then trade insults until one scores a decisive hit over the other. If that victim\u2019s comeback is weaker than the one before it, he loses the impromptu contest and the Willpower points. As with Opening Salvo, the player must actually come up with a retort reasonably quickly. She doesn\u2019t have to be Hamlet running circles around Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, she just has to give it the old college try. Be warned, though: If you (the player) know you get tongue-tied when the heat is on and your Storyteller or fellow players are ruthless bastards, this Knack might not be the one for you.",

The Scion\u2019s Epic Wits allow him to adjust his offense immediately after failing to touch an enemy. After missing an opponent with an attack, the Scion\u2019s player spends one point of Legend. On the Scion\u2019s next attack against that same opponent, the player adds his character\u2019s Epic Wits as extra dice on the attack roll, to a maximum of +3. For demigods, the player may spend two points of Legend to increase the bonus to a maximum of +6, and for Gods, the player may spend three points of Legend to increase the bonus to the character\u2019s full Epic Wits rating with no maximum.

People \ufb02 ock around him like the paparazzi on Oscar night, desperate to be near him and get his attention, and they\u2019ll follow him from locale to locale for as long as he keeps leading them. Mortals can resist this compulsion, but doing so requires a successful (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll with a dif\ufb01culty equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. Successful resistance breaks the spell for the rest of its duration; a failure means the character cannot try to break away again for another hour. The demigod character can have as many lingering groupies and hangers on as his Epic Charisma dots normally grant him bonus successes on Charisma rolls. Scions use this Knack not only to gather up fellow revelers for long, roving parties, but also to surround themselves with unwitting human shields.

            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Control \nCost: 1 Willpower + 1 Legend \nThe Scion can now exert total control over her victim for a limited time. She must be using Rada\u2019s Eyes to share the victim\u2019s perceptions, and she must spend a point of Willpower and a point of Legend to assert full control. (The victim\u2019s chance to resist is the same as for Petro\u2019s Hands.) If the Scion succeeds in her possession attempt, she can \u201cride\u201d around inside her victim\u2019s body for one scene (or less if she chooses to end the effect early). She exerts all of her own mundane traits, except for Appearance, through the effectively empty husk, losing all sense of the situation around her own body."
