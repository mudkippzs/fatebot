When he\u2019s in the presence of a Fated character whose role has been activated by proximity to someone to whom that Fated person is bound, he gets a tingle up the base of his neck. If he spends one Legend point, he tunes that sensation in, which reveals which character is the Fated one and to whom she is bound, if the object of the bond is also nearby.

                "The Scion can automatically recognize any people to whom she is Fatebound. She can pick their faces out of a crowd with just a glance. She can recognize their voices despite electronic distortion or overpowering background noise. She knows their scents and their body language and even the exact feel of the way they shake hands. She can also recognize an imposter when someone tries to mimic the voice or appearance of someone to whom she is Fatebound. Recognizing others is not quite as easy. If, when a Scion encounters a character to whom she is not Fatebound, she makes a concerted effort to try to remember that character\u2019s looks and mannerisms, the player may spend a point of Willpower to lock that image in the Scion\u2019s mind. After that, she retains the ability to recognize him despite all obfuscation for the rest of the story as if they two were Fatebound. Thereafter, the Scion loses any supernatural ability she had to recognize that character. (She doesn\u2019t forget what the character looks like, mind you. It\u2019s just that the Knack no longer applies to that person.) The timing of when the Scion recognizes a person is entirely up to the Storyteller as dictated by the needs of the story. If the private investigator who\u2019s been dogging the Scion\u2019s heels tries to slink up to the character in disguise at a crowded charity fund-raiser, the Scion might see the gumshoe coming a mile away (even despite the fake beard, the fat suit, the spray-on tan and the sex change). If a Scion of Loki who\u2019s a rival to a player\u2019s Scion of Anubis arrives in disguise to deliver a cryptic warning, the Scion of Anubis might not recognize her old foe until the trickster disappears with a wink behind the elevator\u2019s closing doors. Finally, as a side effect of this Knack, a Scion can always recognize when someone who is not in disguise is biologically related to a person she knows well (regardless of whether that person is Fatebound to her). She cannot intuitively grasp what that relationship is, but she knows it\u2019s there\u2014even if the person in question doesn\u2019t.",

All matter is just a particularly dense form of Qi, and the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams govern all their transformations. A scholar of the Great Principle of Change can nudge this potential for change into new paths, and so transform matter into new forms and substances. To do this, she need merely touch the object and trace out the trigrams that represent the sort of change she desires. For a small change, she can trace the trigrams with her finger. Large objects (anything larger than person-sized) requires drawing trigrams on the object using ink, chalk or some other means."

            "Natural Camouflage",
            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Stealth \nCost: 1 Legend \nWhen the Scion hides in her verdant element, it\u2019s almost impossible to find her. Her skin sprouts grass, bark, underbrush, flowers, mushrooms or what have you that allow her to blend in seamlessly with her natural surroundings. As long as she doesn\u2019t move or otherwise draw attention to herself, mundane attempts to find or track her fail automatically. A mortal hunter with a trusty hound could walk right over the Scion\u2019s disguised back and never know she was there. Hunters of supernatural prowess fare only a little better. Those with the Epic Perception Knack Predatory Focus or a Survival Arete can attempt to track the hidden Scion\u2019s movements, their players rolling (Perception + Survival) against the hiding Scion\u2019s activation roll. Even if they get more successes than the Scion\u2019s player did, though, the hunters find only the general area in which the Scion is hiding. (They come to an area within a number of yards equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend but lose track of her unless she moves again.) Only hunters with the Supernal Hunter Knack are actually skilled enough to find a Scion who\u2019s using this Boon to hide (and only if their rolls garner more successes than the Scion\u2019s)."

            "Flamin' Bullets",
            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend per scene \nThe Scion reaches into a source of flame \u2014 anything from a candle to a bonfire will do \u2014 and then \u201cloads\u201d that fire into a projectile weapon. The weapon becomes wreathed in flames, and for the rest of the scene, the weapon belches blasts of Legend-fueled fire. The weapon still consumes normal ammunition, but the shots become imbued with \u201cfire power,\u201d so to speak. The fiery rounds also inflict lethal damage, even against creatures that normally take bashing damage from bullets, such as the walking dead. The fiery rounds add +1 Accuracy and Damage to the weapon and also allow it to light targets on fire. Shooting the gas tank of a car with a pistol really can produce an explosive ending when Flamin\u2019 Bullets are used."
