Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool.

For a second, the Scion\u2019s ichor seeps into that small point no larger than a fingernail, and that part of the Scion\u2019s body becomes tremendously difficult to damage. The area affected gains a Hardness rating (see Scion: Hero, p. 201) equal to the Scion\u2019s Epic Stamina. Any attack with fewer damage dice than the Hardness rating simply bounces off with no effect, while an attack with more damage dice loses a number of dice equal to the Hardness rating before the Scion attempts to soak it (as a special extension of Hardness, which normally only applies to inanimate objects). The real trick lies in positioning this tiny, invulnerable spot to absorb an attack. Normally, a Scion uses his Parry DV to defect attacks in this fashion. Since the Scion has the Body Armor Knack as a prerequisite, he can already Parry melee attacks. Instead, Invulnerable Nail provides the Scion with a defense against an attack that he can see coming but can\u2019t parry, such as when he\u2019s held in place by a titanspawn\u2019s tentacle and needs to make his forehead momentarily impenetrable to the oncoming needle- tipped appendage that will try to suck out his brain. In such a case, the Scion keeps his full unarmed Parry DV because he can try to defect the attack at the last moment by anticipating where it will strike and fortifying that part of his body. Similarly, a clever Scion might feign suicide by attacking himself with a mundane weapon and defecting it at the last minute through the use of this Knack. Activating this Knack costs two points of Legend. It is a reflexive action done in response to an attack.",

            "Cradlesong",
            "Dice Pool: Manipulation + Medicine \nCost: 1 Legend (or 1 Legend + 1 Willpower) \nBy singing or playing some sweet lullaby, the Scion makes a number of people equal to the successes on the activation roll drift quietly off to sleep. Characters of higher Legend than the singer are not affected. Those of equal Legend get to oppose the activation roll with a (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll. This soporific effect knocks out any living creature that can hear the Scion\u2019s voice, for a number of hours equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. Victims with no Legend rating remain asleep the whole time, never waking up regardless of what\u2019s going on around them. Characters with a Legend rating can be woken up by those who went unaffected, if the player of the character trying to rouse the sleeper makes more successes on an extended (Manipulation + Medicine) action to bring the sleeper around. (Such an action constitutes shaking the sleeping person, slapping his cheeks, pinching him, hollering at him or whatever else might wake him from a dead sleep.) Suffering a level of lethal or aggravated damage will also wake a sleeper with a Legend rating."

            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Craft \nCost: 1 Legend + 1 Willpower \nDefying the laws of thermodynamics, the Scion can instantly change the state of a body of water just by touching it. With this Boon, she can take liquid water, steam, ice or fog and change any one into any of the other three. The amount of water she can affect is the same as per Water Control, and the water remains in its new state for a number of actions equal to the successes rolled to activate the Boon. Water under this effect is also subject to the Scion\u2019s Water Control as long as the Scion maintains contact with some portion of it."

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: None \nWhether the character is caught up in a landslide, buried in a shallow grave by the roadside or trapped in the rubble of a collapsing building, he need not fear the earth\u2019s embrace as long as he has his Earth Birthright. No amount of collapsing rubble can break the Scion\u2019s bones (or the Birthright itself), and he won\u2019t suffocate no matter how much dirt piles onto him. If he lacks the strength to free himself, however, he does run the risk of either starving to death or dying of thirst if no one digs him out. Yet, it would not be the earth that kills him, but his own lack of fortitude."

            "Water Control",
            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Craft \nCost: 1 Legend \nFor a number of actions equal to the successes on the activation roll, the Scion can exert limited physical control of any water that is touching her. She can remotely manipulate a hand-held object she can see in the water with her full dice pool, although she can take no other physical actions at the same time. She can stiffen the water beneath her feet in order to walk on its surface. She can even have the water push her along from all sides, allowing her to take a full Move action while swimming, rather than half. Alternatively, moving through the water thus could increase her Dodge DV by an amount equal to her Legend as long as she does nothing but dodge incoming attacks."

            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Craft (to shape) \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion can sculpt stone, concrete, fired clay or metal with his bare hands. When he spends the point of Legend, the substance becomes malleable like wet clay for as long as he touches it. With a successful (Dexterity + Craft) roll by his player, the Scion can shape it into any form his nimble fingers can produce. The Scion can affect up to one cubic foot of material at a time. Once he breaks contact with the substance he is shaping, it loses all malleability and sets in its new form."
