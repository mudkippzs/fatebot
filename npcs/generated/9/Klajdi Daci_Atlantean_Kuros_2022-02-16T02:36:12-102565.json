This Knack comes in handy in the ballroom, the bedroom, even the thick of battle. The first two applications might not come up as often in play, but they shouldn\u2019t be discounted out of hand. The dance performance of two characters with this Knack would put the best work of Fred Astair and Ginger Rogers to shame. The sexual prowess of a character with this Knack would be legendary all on its own. The third application of this Knack makes coordinating assaults (see Scion: Hero, p. 190) that much easier. Using it, a character can attach herself to any coordinated assault she sees fit, without the player of the person coordinating the assault having to include the character in the dice roll to do so. If the character with this Knack wants to coordinate her attack with only one other person, neither of them even has to make a roll to do so. As long as they act at the same time and attack the same target, they are coordinated by default.",

When someone attacks her character with a successful clinch, the Scion\u2019s player not only adds her Epic Dexterity automatic successes to her contested (Dexterity + Brawl) to escape, but she also adds an additional automatic success for every dot of Epic Dexterity her character has. Should the Scion victim\u2019s player succeed on this resistance roll, the Scion slips free of her opponent\u2019s grasping limbs and well out of his reach. Also, should a character be physically restrained\u2014tied up, handcuffed, strapped down, whatever\u2014she can slip her bonds with a divine grace that is nothing short of baf\ufb02ing. The player need only spend a point of Legend, and her character\u2019s handcuffs come undone, her straightjacket\u2019s buckles come loose, or her ropes slough off like a snake\u2019s dried-out skin.

Remote witnesses watching via camera transmission don\u2019t hinder the effect, but even close scrutiny of such footage doesn\u2019t reveal how the Scion escaped her bonds. She just did.",
