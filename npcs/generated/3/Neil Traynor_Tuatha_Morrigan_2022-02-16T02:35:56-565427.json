                "Prerequisite Knack: Serpent\u2019s Gaze (Scion: Hero, p. 133) As with the prerequisite Knack, Compelling Performance draws a victim\u2019s attention to the Scion and renders him unable to look away. The victim remains Inactive for combat purposes, staring helplessly at the hideous monster or unearthly beauty before him. Unlike Serpent\u2019s Gaze, though, the Scion need not consciously maintain eye contact with her victim for the effect to endure. Once the victim has been trans\ufb01xed by the Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance, he remains thus until either the end of the scene or until the Scion leaves his line of sight. The victim will follow the Scion with his eyes, even turn in place if she wanders around the immediate area, but he can\u2019t do anything other than look at her. What\u2019s more, the Scion can capture a number of victims with her appearance equal to her (Epic Appearance + Legend) total. Her player only spends one point of Legend per person up to the maximum, and they all stop what they\u2019re doing to stare at her in rapt fascination. When the effect ends, they remember nothing that happened after the \ufb01rst moment they saw the Scion. Mortals and Scions of lesser or equal Legend are unable to look away on their own, but Scions with a greater Legend are not so vulnerable. After the Scion using the Knack takes one full action, the higher-Legend victim may spend a point of Willpower to negate the effect. In so doing, he remains immune to the effect from the same Scion for the rest of the scene.",

                "The Scion is so strong that he can direct his incredible power through the ground or \ufb02oor to affect enemies at range. Doing so takes two separate forms. First, the character can stomp or strike the ground with his \ufb01sts or a weapon, which sends a shock wave outward from him along the ground across an area with a radius equal to his Epic Strength in yards. Striking the ground thus to send out the shock wave requires a Strength roll, which receives the bene\ufb01t of his Epic Strength. Potential victims \u2014 friend and foe alike \u2014 compare their Dodge DV to the results of this roll. If their DV overcomes the Scion\u2019s successes, they manage to jump and let the shock wave pass beneath them. If their DV isn\u2019t high enough, they immediately suffer knockdown as well as an amount of bashing damage equal to however many of the Scion\u2019s successes their DV couldn\u2019t cancel out. (If his allies know the Scion is about to use this Knack \u2014 if his using it is part of a coordinated assault, for instance \u2014 they can jump out of the way preemptively without having to rely on their DVs.) This attack in\ufb02icts no damage on the \ufb02oor or the ground the Scion strikes. All the energy is expended into the shock wave. The second form this power takes is more selective and deliberate. As with the \ufb01rst form, the Scion strikes the ground and sends a shock wave along the surface out to a distance equal to his Epic Strength in yards. This time, though, his player makes a standard Dexterity-based attack roll and targets a single opponent. If that opponent\u2019s Dodge DV isn\u2019t high enough to get him out of the way of the attack, the Scion\u2019s player then makes a Strength roll, modi\ufb01ed by his Epic Strength but not modi\ufb01ed by his extra successes on the attack roll. The damage this attack in\ufb02icts is bashing, but it has one other effect that renders the victim almost helpless for a moment afterward. Any successes on the Strength roll that exceed the victim\u2019s soak not only in\ufb02ict damage but also hurl the victim straight up in the air (one yard per unsoaked success). The victim\u2019s rise and fall takes six ticks, during which his DVs are considered to be halved. He can make ranged attacks at a -5 penalty, but he can\u2019t move or jump or do much of anything until he lands again. In fact, if the Scion\u2019s attack sends him high enough in the air, the victim might take damage from crashing back down from so great a height. Using either form of this Knack requires the expenditure of one Legend point.",

                "Scions of Hel are almost always awesomely hideous, while Scions of Aphrodite are generally phenomenally attractive. With this Knack, though, a Scion can have the best of both worlds. Once a Scion chooses this Knack, she can shift her Epic Appearance from hideous to beautiful at will. The player simply expends the requisite Legend cost and the Scion\u2019s mien transforms. In either form, she is still recognizable as herself; she cannot use this Knack to change her appearance, unless she also has a Knack like Detail Variation from p. 71 of Scion: God. However, she can change from an elegant, refined woman to a vengeful, nerve-wracking hag in the blink of an eye. Once she transforms thus, her range of available Epic Appearance Knacks shifts as appropriate. While beautiful, then, the Scion can invoke all of her known Epic Appearance Knacks that rely on great beauty; while hideous, she can invoke any of her Epic Appearance Knacks that require a monstrous countenance. Once a Scion learns this Knack, she can freely purchase any Epic Appearance Knack that would normally require incredible beauty or incredible monstrosity. She can only use the Knacks appropriate to the form that she currently bears, though. Activating this Knack costs three points of Legend. The Scion remains in her switched state until she decides to activate the Knack again. (Indeed, both of them are her \u201cnatural\u201d state; she simply has the ability to swap between them as desired.)"

By spending a point of Legend to activate the Knack, the Scion can extend this feat for a maximum number of days equal to her Legend rating. As long as she continues this specific feat of strength, she ignores hunger, thirst, exhaustion and other factors that might otherwise interrupt her. Without this Knack, a Scion cannot possibly continue a feat of strength longer than a single scene. A Scion can use this Knack to hold up any weight she can lift or keep a creature that\u2019s fastened to a rope or line from getting away. By tightening her neck muscles, she could even hang by her neck without suffocating. The Scion must stay virtually immobile, however. A Scion could keep a mine from caving in, hang from a noose for days or drag a chained beast slowly toward her, but she could not run, jump or perform most combat actions. A Scion is still limited by her normal and Epic Strength ratings, though she can perform feats at the top of her capabilities for days using this Knack. If she lacks Epic Stamina Knacks such as Holy Fortitude, though, she will probably collapse in helpless exhaustion the moment she finally ends the feat of strength."

                "As Scions build up ever more dots of Epic Appearance, they grow ever more unearthly. As such, whether they\u2019re beautiful or quite the opposite, it becomes increasingly difficult to deal with mortal humans on their level. The Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance can\u2019t help but get in the way. This Knack, however, mitigates that factor. When the Scion\u2019s player spends a point of Willpower to activate it for the scene, any mortals who see the character completely ignore his Appearance score (both Epic and mundane). Witnesses might vaguely remember that a beautiful Scion was kind of pretty or that a disgustingly ugly Scion was dirty and a little scary, but that\u2019s it. They won\u2019t recognize the Scion again later unless the Scion uses this Knack in their presence again, and they won\u2019t be able to describe the Scion in great detail to anyone else. They might get height, hair color, skin tone, build and style of dress right, but details beyond those generalities prove elusive. Scions themselves are immune to this effect, as they are more than capable of dealing with the extremes that Epic Appearance represents. This Knack lasts for the scene, though the Scion can choose to turn off the effect before then. Also, while he\u2019s using this Knack to deal with a mortal, he cannot use any other Epic Appearance Knacks against him. Nor can he apply his Epic Appearance to rolls pertaining to dealing with that mortal at all until he lifts the effect.",

The prerequisite Knack enables him to in\ufb02ict lethal damage during a clinch that he controls, and this Knack builds on that to awful effect.

What\u2019s more, his normal unarmed combat attacks now in\ufb02ict lethal damage instead of bashing damage. Keep in mind that that lethal damage is now the standard damage he in\ufb02icts unarmed, regardless of whether he spends the point of Legend to make a single clinch\u2019s damage aggravated.
