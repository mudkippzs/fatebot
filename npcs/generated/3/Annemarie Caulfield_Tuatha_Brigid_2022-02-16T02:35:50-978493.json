The prerequisite Knack enables him to in\ufb02ict lethal damage during a clinch that he controls, and this Knack builds on that to awful effect. If the Scion spends a point of Legend during a clinch, he can make a single attack in\ufb02ict aggravated damage instead of lethal. What\u2019s more, his normal unarmed combat attacks now in\ufb02ict lethal damage instead of bashing damage. Keep in mind that that lethal damage is now the standard damage he in\ufb02icts unarmed, regardless of whether he spends the point of Legend to make a single clinch\u2019s damage aggravated. The Scion can pull his punches and in\ufb02ict only bashing damage if he wants to, but doing so incurs the \u201cFlat of the Blade\u201d rule from page 199 of Scion: Hero.",

With this Knack, any tool or item that the Scion picks up benefits from the same bends and loopholes in the laws of physics that allow Epic Strength to defy both leverage and structural integrity. The Scion could use a wooden board to clobber a thug, or he could ram a flimsy iron fireplace poker right through a wall of concrete with the full force of his Epic Strength. In either case, the tool would remain reasonably intact (albeit with some cosmetic wear). Such guarantees are particularly handy when using an object of questionable strength to beat a titanspawn to death without destroying the item in question (such as a snow globe intended as a present). Note that Titanium Tools doesn\u2019t improve the Hardness or rigidity of an item. A cheap katana can still be snapped in half by an angry titanspawn that decides to target the blade. A limp spaghetti noodle is no better a weapon with this Knack than without. Titanium Tools simply allows the Scion to use objects that might be feasible as weapons under normal circumstances and subject them to the extraordinary effects of his Epic Strength without breaking them, for as long as he wields the object.",

Thus, if she\u2019s filled in the first four boxes of her health levels, the Scion gains a +2 bonus on all of her appropriate rolls instead of taking the normal -2 penalty. Even if her Epic Stamina would obviate the penalty in whole or in part, she still gains the full bonus. Scions whose Epic Stamina grants them additional health levels count those boxes as having a -4 penalty (and thus a +4 bonus for purposes of this Knack). Furthermore, every time a Scion using Raging Bull suffers an injury (be it a single level of bashing damage or ten levels of aggravated damage), the player may choose to spend one point of Legend to restore one expended point of Willpower.

With this Knack, however, a character can hurl an object that he can lift and throw as a feat of strength as far as he can throw a dart without penalties deriving from Range. The sort of epic feats this Knack allow work best as narrative effects in combat, as the logistics of hurling such projectiles as fire stations, the Washington Monument or J\u00f6rmungandr at one\u2019s enemies can get somewhat more math-intensive than is strictly ideal. Hurl to the Moon does not affect the distance a character can throw a normal-sized object, but it does intensify the damage such an object can cause. Such damage is considered aggravated, and the projectile takes on the Piercing quality if it does not already have it. Each attack thus enhanced costs the God two points of Legend, however.",
