                "Prerequisite Knack: Blessing of Importance (Scion: Hero, p. 130) A heroic Scion with Epic Charisma can help restore a mortal\u2019s sense of self worth and empowerment just by paying a bit of attention to him and making him feel special. The charismatic Scion can even replenish a measure of the same for one of his fellow Scions. A demigod Scion\u2019s attention makes a person feel even more important, though, especially when the Scion goes out of his way to treat the person like a true friend. When the demigod does so (and spends a point of Legend), he completely re\ufb01 lls a fellow Scion\u2019s spent Willpower points (if that amount is higher than the charismatic Scion\u2019s Epic Charisma). Should he treat a mortal with such affection, the mortal not only regains all his spent Willpower, as per Blessing of Importance, he gains an extra dot of Willpower for the scene. When that extra dot goes away at the end of the scene, the mortal\u2019s spent Willpower completely replenishes again. The Scion can affect a person only once per scene with this Knack.",

Mortals and Scions who hear it are so inspired that their spent Willpower points are entirely re\ufb01lled. This Knack also has a more insidious dimension. If the Scion \ufb01nds himself in charge of a group of titanspawn, he can spend a point of Willpower and give those awful minions a speech that empowers them just as Inspirational Figure inspires mortals. Each titanspawn who hears him regains a point of spent Willpower. Scions who might be opposed to the titanspawn\u2019s goals don\u2019t receive any bene\ufb01t from this inspirational speech, but they are compelled to let the demigod \ufb01nish what he has to say before they do something about it.",

When the Scion invokes Boys Will Be Boys in order to calm the anger of an authority figure after a disaster, the player can choose to spend two additional Legend points and invoke Blame James as well. Then, the Scion just glances at someone else, makes a brief comment about \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t my idea\u2026\u201d or somehow gives the impression that the narrowly-averted trouble was the result of someone else\u2019s malfeasance. So impressive is the Scion\u2019s demeanor that the disciplinary authority figure becomes convinced that the named individual had something to do with the event, and is in some way culpable.

Normally, the burden of portraying this Knack falls to the player, so it behooves her to keep an ear to the ground for obscure trivia she can work into her character\u2019s dialogue during the game. The Storyteller shares a bit of that burden as well, though. During a scene in which the characters seem to be stumped or hopelessly out of options, the Storyteller should \u201cremind\u201d the player of some pertinent bit of obscure trivia her character knows that bears a direct, helpful relevance to the problem at hand.
