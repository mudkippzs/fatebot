                "Scions of Hel are almost always awesomely hideous, while Scions of Aphrodite are generally phenomenally attractive. With this Knack, though, a Scion can have the best of both worlds. Once a Scion chooses this Knack, she can shift her Epic Appearance from hideous to beautiful at will. The player simply expends the requisite Legend cost and the Scion\u2019s mien transforms. In either form, she is still recognizable as herself; she cannot use this Knack to change her appearance, unless she also has a Knack like Detail Variation from p. 71 of Scion: God. However, she can change from an elegant, refined woman to a vengeful, nerve-wracking hag in the blink of an eye. Once she transforms thus, her range of available Epic Appearance Knacks shifts as appropriate. While beautiful, then, the Scion can invoke all of her known Epic Appearance Knacks that rely on great beauty; while hideous, she can invoke any of her Epic Appearance Knacks that require a monstrous countenance. Once a Scion learns this Knack, she can freely purchase any Epic Appearance Knack that would normally require incredible beauty or incredible monstrosity. She can only use the Knacks appropriate to the form that she currently bears, though. Activating this Knack costs three points of Legend. The Scion remains in her switched state until she decides to activate the Knack again. (Indeed, both of them are her \u201cnatural\u201d state; she simply has the ability to swap between them as desired.)"

By spending two Legend points, the Scion can, for the rest of the scene, automatically see through all illusions created by a being whose Legend is less than her own. In addition, the Scion can recognize the telltale signs of the illusionist\u2019s signature, if she has encountered that character\u2019s deceptions before. She can\u2019t sense an illusion and pull information from nowhere about its creator (that requires the Mystery Purview), but she could sense, \u201cThis is one of Loki\u2019s tricks,\u201d if the Lie-Smith had fooled her before. The one exception to the use of this Knack is trying to see through illusions and supernatural deceptions created by beings with either Ultimate Manipulation or the avatar expression of the Illusion Purview. The abilities of these divine tricksters transcend normal means of detection. A God who employs Ultimate Perception, however, has a chance to see through such illusions anyway. Ultimate Perception and use of this Knack guarantees success.",

When the Scion invokes Boys Will Be Boys in order to calm the anger of an authority figure after a disaster, the player can choose to spend two additional Legend points and invoke Blame James as well. Then, the Scion just glances at someone else, makes a brief comment about \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t my idea\u2026\u201d or somehow gives the impression that the narrowly-averted trouble was the result of someone else\u2019s malfeasance. So impressive is the Scion\u2019s demeanor that the disciplinary authority figure becomes convinced that the named individual had something to do with the event, and is in some way culpable. This Knack only functions if the use of Boys Will Be Boys also functioned; if that attempt fails, then this Knack also fails, although the Legend points are still spent",

The star-struck victim tries to move to a nearby room, balcony, Jacuzzi or other spot as instructed, in hopes that the Scion will soon arrive. The power of the Knack does all of the convincing. The Scion\u2019s player simply spends one Legend point and picks a single recipient, as with the Come Hither Knack. As usual, the intended recipient must be able to see an image of the Scion, must understand that the message is for her and must have a reasonable idea of how to find him. Meet Me Backstage doesn\u2019t interrupt a subject\u2019s self-preservation any more than Come Hither does: While the subject makes all due haste to reach the appointed meeting place, \u201cdue haste\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cdie along the way.\u201d Nevertheless, this Knack is excellent for discreet rendezvous as well as setting up a poor sap for a beat-down party.

A charmed person can still think clearly, question one\u2019s motives and turn someone down if something about what she\u2019s saying doesn\u2019t feel quite right. Not so the person affected by this Knack. The character who uses it spends one Legend point as his player rolls (Charisma + Presence + Legend). The victim\u2019s player contests this effect with a (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll. If the victim\u2019s roll fails to garner the necessary successes, the victim falls madly, unquestioningly in love with the user of the Knack for a number of days equal to the user\u2019s threshold successes. The victim is blindly enthralled and will do anything in her power to please the object of her affection. This Knack works regardless of the relative Legend disparity between the user and his victim. Using it unwisely against a more powerful character is ill advised, however. Fool Odin once, shame on him. Fool him twice, wolves on you.",

A character with this Knack doesn\u2019t have that problem. For the cost of one Legend point, the character can change some minor physical detail such as eye color, hair length, hair color, hairstyle or skin tone.

The character can also use this Knack to go from filthy to perfectly clean in an instant, as well as to remove any minor scars from past injuries.

The only catch is that the Scion must be actively searching for each sensation\u2014the default assumption is that his senses are those of a regular mortal.
