A Scion might be accident- prone or have an infuriating talent for picking \ufb01ghts with titanspawn that are out of her league, but she takes her lumps with a smile and inspires her fellows with her can-do attitude. All she has to do is \ufb02ash a thumbs-up, holler an \u201cI\u2019m okay!\u201d or show a smile full of dangling teeth. When she does, all the Scions in her Band who can see her gain one Willpower point per health level the character has suffered (i.e., however many are marked on her character sheet at that moment). The character can inspire her fellows thus only once per scene, but she can do so even if she\u2019s knocked to Incapacitated or killed\u2014after which, she collapses.",

For every Legend point spent, the character can hold everyone\u2019s attention for a number of minutes equal to his Epic Appearance dots. The onlookers can carry on with what they\u2019re doing and keep talking among themselves, but their attention remains \ufb01xed on the Scion. Titanspawn and Scions can resist this Knack. They may spend a point of Willpower to direct their attention elsewhere.

He can change racial characteristics or make dramatic changes in his weight or height. He can even change genders (and be completely fertile in the new form) or exhibit characteristics of both (and be fertile in both). Any morphology and physiognomy that exists on the spectrum of human variety is a valid change. When the character is finished, his new Appearance can be from one dot to as many dots as he actually has. His Epic Appearance dots are automatically included at their full value, but they can be suppressed normally with My Eyes Are Up Here. The character can also use this Knack to perfectly mimic the appearance of anyone he has seen. Doing so requires a (Dexterity + Empathy) roll with a difficulty equal to (1 + that person\u2019s Legend). More generic alteration requires no roll, but any use of this Knack costs five Legend points to realize the finish product.",

A beautiful Scion can use her Epic Appearance to make a character feel good about himself, granting him an extra Willpower point (which may exceed the character\u2019s maximum) and an extra die on any Art, Athletics, Command, Craft or Integrity dice pools. A hideous Scion in\ufb02icts quite the opposite effect. The fear she instills robs her victim of a Willpower point that he cannot regain until the effect wears off. The Scion also unsettles him so deeply that he loses one die from all Academics, Awareness, Control, Politics or Presence dice pools.

Spending a point of Legend and a point of Willpower, the Scion burns a mental vision of himself so deeply into the victim\u2019s mind that everyone the victim sees thereafter who\u2019s of the same sex as the Scion seems to be wearing the Scion\u2019s face. This effect is especially jarring because other features such as height, weight, hairstyle, skin tone and whatnot don\u2019t change from what\u2019s natural for the person the victim is actually seeing. Only the Scion\u2019s face stands out, sized and colored as appropriate for the person on hand, yet still undeniably the Scion\u2019s own. Shaking off this disorienting hallucination costs the victim a point of Willpower, but that doesn\u2019t end the effect. An hour later, the effect creeps back up on the victim until every person of the appropriate gender has the Scion\u2019s face again. Even worse, a character cannot regain spent Willpower points while he\u2019s languishing under this effect. The only hope for a mortal victim is that the Scion will track him down and decide to end the effect. The demigod can do the same for Scion victims as well, but in the children of the Gods, the effect will wear off on its own after the victim has spent 24 hours with no points of Willpower.",
