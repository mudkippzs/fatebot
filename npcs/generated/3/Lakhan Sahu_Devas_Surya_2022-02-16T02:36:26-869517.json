The prerequisite Knack enables him to in\ufb02ict lethal damage during a clinch that he controls, and this Knack builds on that to awful effect. If the Scion spends a point of Legend during a clinch, he can make a single attack in\ufb02ict aggravated damage instead of lethal. What\u2019s more, his normal unarmed combat attacks now in\ufb02ict lethal damage instead of bashing damage. Keep in mind that that lethal damage is now the standard damage he in\ufb02icts unarmed, regardless of whether he spends the point of Legend to make a single clinch\u2019s damage aggravated. The Scion can pull his punches and in\ufb02ict only bashing damage if he wants to, but doing so incurs the \u201cFlat of the Blade\u201d rule from page 199 of Scion: Hero.",

                "Prerequisite Knack: Overt Order (Scion: Hero, p. 131) With a moment of eye contact and the expenditure of a Willpower point, the Scion instantly plunges a mortal into a hypnotic trance. Attempting to hypnotize a fellow Scion of lesser or equal (Willpower + Legend) requires not only a Willpower expenditure but a (Manipulation + Command + Legend) roll contested against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). Scions cannot instantly hypnotize fellow Scions of higher (Willpower + Legend). Should he successfully hypnotize a victim, the Scion can implant one hidden command that the victim must obey at the time of the Scion\u2019s choosing. The command must be something that the victim can accomplish in one scene, and the trigger condition that compels him to attempt it must occur within a number of months equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. The Scion can give as speci\ufb01c an order as he pleases, and a mortal cannot interpret it in any way other than the spirit in which it was intended. A fellow Scion can interpret it loosely to his own advantage, as per Overt Order, but doing so costs him a point of Willpower. The victim remains unaware of the ticking time bomb in his subconscious, but he does have a chance to resist it when the trigger condition occurs. At the moment when he has been commanded to perform the action in question, the victim\u2019s player may make a (Wits + Integrity) roll. (This roll cannot be modi\ufb01ed by a Scion\u2019s Epic Wits or an Integrity Arete.) If the roll garners more successes than the hypnotist Scion has dots of Legend, the compulsion is broken. If the last-minute resistance roll fails, the victim must attempt to do as he was commanded. Whether he succeeds or fails, the compulsion ends after he makes the attempt, and he has no memory of what could possibly have convinced him to do as he did.",

As a response to an incoming attack, the Scion\u2019s player spends one point of Legend and rolls (Manipulation + Empathy + Legend) against the opponent\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). If the player wins, then the attacker hesitates for the barest instant, and his attack delays to the next tick.

                "Prerequisite Knack: Holy Bound (Scion: Hero, p. 126) A character with this Knack cannot necessarily fly, but the difference between using this Knack and flying is a subtlety that is easily lost on mortal onlookers. For the cost of 10 Legend points, this Knack converts the distance increment a character can jump from yards to hundreds of yards. That is, the character can leap the distance of one football field straight up for every dot of (Strength + Athletics) she has plus the bonus number granted by her Epic Strength. She can jump twice that length horizontally. At Strength 12, Athletics 5 and Epic Strength 10 (plus accounting for this Knack\u2019s prerequisite), the character can leap a little bit more than seven miles straight up \u2014 which is about one and a half miles higher than the peak of Mount Everest \u2014 or more than 14 miles horizontally. Used in combat, this Knack makes jumping something more than a Speed 5 miscellaneous action. When a character takes a leap that can potentially carry her for miles, that action is typically narrated rather than played out tick by tick. If no one can fly after her, leap after her or run fast enough to keep up with her, the character effectively leaves combat. In \u201cflight,\u201d the character retains her full DVs and attack dice pools. This Knack also makes jumping more dangerous than it normally is. Normally, a character can always safely fall from the maximum height to which she can normally jump. This Knack, however, overrides that safety standard by extending a person\u2019s jumping height to preposterous extremes. If a character who uses this Knack to leap aeronautically is successfully attacked in flight and that attack inflicts enough damage to cause knockdown or knockback, the character\u2019s prodigious leap turns into an uncontrolled fall. The player gets one chance per dot of Epic Strength the character has to succeed on a (Dexterity + Athletics) roll. If she does succeed, the character retains her aerial poise and lands, if not gracefully, at least safely. If the roll fails, the character suffers damage relevant to falling from a great height.",

The Scion of Ogoun needs a distraction so he can slip out the back before the Scion of Sobek notices him and turns him into mincemeat. After a quick glance around, the Scion of Ogoun motions to the bartender and orders a drink for a pretty girl across the room. He also pays off his tab. As the waitress takes the drink over, a sour-faced middle-aged man exits the restroom and walks back toward the table where his shrewish wife is waiting. The waitress hands the drink to the pretty girl and points back toward the Scion of Ogoun, but the middle-aged man just happens to be in the way. The pretty girl waves and smiles her thanks, and the middle-aged man smiles back in distracted confusion as the Scion of Ogoun tips the girl a wink. It\u2019s at this point that the Scion of Sobek enters and notices the Scion of Ogoun putting on his jacket. As the Scion of Sobek comes toward the Scion of Ogoun\u2019s seat, the middle-aged man meets his shrewish wife heading toward him. Having misinterpreted the pretty girl\u2019s wave of thanks to the Scion of Ogoun, she demands to know why her husband bought a strange girl a drink.

The cost, dice pool, restrictions and resistance mechanics of this Knack are the same as for Instant Hypnosis.
