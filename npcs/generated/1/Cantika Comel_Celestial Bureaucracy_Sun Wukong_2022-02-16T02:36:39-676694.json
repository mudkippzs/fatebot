The Scion concentrates, touches another character who is using a Boon or spell, and spends a point of Legend. This enhances the target character\u2019s use of the Boon or spell as if his Legend were one higher than its actual value. For instance, a dice pool that included the character\u2019s Legend would gain one die, or the recipient\u2019s Legend would be treated as one higher than its real value (for purposes of Boons whose effectiveness depends on the attacker\u2019s Legend being equal or higher than his target\u2019s)."
