                "When people who are bound by Fate move around, the threads that connect them vibrate. The closer they are to one another, the higher the frequency of that vibration grows and the more noticeable it is. Most people and Gods instinctively ignore this sensation, but a character with this Knack can choose not to tune it out. When he\u2019s in the presence of a Fated character whose role has been activated by proximity to someone to whom that Fated person is bound, he gets a tingle up the base of his neck. If he spends one Legend point, he tunes that sensation in, which reveals which character is the Fated one and to whom she is bound, if the object of the bond is also nearby. This Knack doesn\u2019t reveal the nature of the bond\u2014such as what Fatebound Role a character might play\u2014only its presence.",

(Doing so costs one Legend.) Thereafter, whenever that subject is in physical danger (as determined by the Storyteller), the Scion receives a reflexive intuition to that effect.

The Scion gains a number of Legend points equal to the number of successes rolled. The story must pertain specifically to the Scion, which the context should make clear. Also, it must be uttered or written without the Scion\u2019s direct knowledge.

She still can\u2019t harm the fragile ectoplasmic shell of a ghost who hasn\u2019t manifested, however. The sense of touch this Boon grants is illusory.
