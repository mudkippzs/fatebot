As such, the player can apply the character\u2019s Epic Intelligence bonus dice to any Intelligence-based roll required to glean information, regardless of whether the character has any dots in the Ability in question. For instance, identifying what martial arts style someone is using would require an (Intelligence + Brawl) roll. With this Knack, a character with no dots in Brawl could handily identify the style, the particular variant of it the student is using and who the student\u2019s teacher most likely was. This Knack works only for rolls intended to dredge up information.",

The character cannot preemptively attack her attacker or even shout out a warning to her comrades, as she\u2019s reacting to an attack that\u2019s already taking place, but she is much more likely to dodge or parry that attack. Nonetheless, the character cannot actually join battle herself until everyone else does after the unexpected attack is resolved.",
