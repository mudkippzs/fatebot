                "Only characters whose Boons include the Sky Purview have more freedom to \ufb02aunt the laws of physics. Simply having Epic Strength enables a Scion to perform prodigious leaps that leave mortals standing slack-jawed with wonder. For example, if a Scion has Strength 5, Athletics 3 and Epic Strength 3, she can jump 12 yards straight up or 24 yards forward. (See \u201cMovement\u201d on p. 180\\.) This Knack, however, doubles a Scion\u2019s vertical and horizontal jumping distances. With it, the aforementioned character could leap an amazing 24 yards straight up (from the ground to a seventh-story balcony, for instance) or 48 yards forward in a single bound.",

Every character on the Scion\u2019s side of the conflict who hears the benediction gains a point of Willpower as well as two temporary bonus dots of Valor that last until the battle ends. The Scion may amplify his voice electronically, but he must be present at the battle and give the blessing live."

To her, ghosts are livid, physical presences, sensible to feeling as to sight (as well as smell and hearing). She still can\u2019t harm the fragile ectoplasmic shell of a ghost who hasn\u2019t manifested, however. The sense of touch this Boon grants is illusory. If the Scion tries to exert enough pressure to cause damage or restrain the ghost, her hand passes through it."

(Doing so costs one Legend.) Thereafter, whenever that subject is in physical danger (as determined by the Storyteller), the Scion receives a reflexive intuition to that effect. Should her player then succeed on a (Perception + Empathy) roll, she gains a clearer understanding of the subject\u2019s condition, location and current situation."

When the Scion receives this Boon, she sees clearly through such physical impediments as smoke, fog, murky water (if the Scion is in said water) or even translucent barriers through which other people can see only silhouettes. The character can even see perfectly clearly in dim light (i.e., light no less intense than a single birthday candle). In total darkness, however, she\u2019s just as blind as the next person."
