                "Prerequisite Knack: Language Mastery (Scion: Demigod, p. 65) As regards the spoken word, this Knack provides much the same benefit as its prerequisite. Yet where Language Mastery requires that the character listen for a while to get a sense of the strange language\u2019s ebb and flow, this Knack allows the character to understand anything that is said to him in any language the moment it is spoken. Where this Knack truly surpasses its prerequisite is that it allows the character to read any written language with which he isn\u2019t familiar, even if it\u2019s written in characters that are completely alien to him. He can\u2019t automatically write with perfect fluency in a new language he can speak or has read, but his written vocabulary is as broad as every word in that language that he has read.",

This perspective allows a clear view of a radius in miles equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. The Scion may focus on any point in the reflection and see it clearly, but he can\u2019t see through physical objects or change the angle from the top-down perspective. This Boon doesn\u2019t function on new moon nights, but it can see down through thick clouds on any other night. If the moon is visible during the day, the Scion can use this Boon then as well."

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe first art of Taiyi is learning to pass Qi to another being to augment his own supernatural force. The Scion concentrates, touches another character who is using a Boon or spell, and spends a point of Legend. This enhances the target character\u2019s use of the Boon or spell as if his Legend were one higher than its actual value. For instance, a dice pool that included the character\u2019s Legend would gain one die, or the recipient\u2019s Legend would be treated as one higher than its real value (for purposes of Boons whose effectiveness depends on the attacker\u2019s Legend being equal or higher than his target\u2019s)."

That plant or patch can then survive for a whole year (or for its whole life if its natural span is shorter) without food or sunlight or water. The Scion\u2019s ministrations keep the plant healthy through drought, nutrient deficiency, unnatural darkness or other environmental shortfall. The plant\u2019s surroundings must be within its natural tolerances for the plant to survive, though. (This Boon can\u2019t nurture seaweed on the desert floor, for instance.) Also, this Boon doesn\u2019t protect against or cure any blight or damage from herbivorous noshing."
