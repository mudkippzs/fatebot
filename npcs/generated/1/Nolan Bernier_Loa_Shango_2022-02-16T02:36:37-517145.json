                "The Scion\u2019s well-chosen words can play on humankind\u2019s social mentality, giving hope and courage to not just one listener, but a group. The Scion gives a speech to gathered listeners\u2014whether he\u2019s calling upon them for help, raising their spirits after a local disaster or strengthening the bonds of community among them\u2014and spends a single point of Legend. As long as his words are intended to inspire them in some way, every person who can hear him listens spellbound and receives a point of Willpower at the speech\u2019s end. The only limit is that the listeners must be able to hear him clearly without him using the aid of any amplifying or broadcasting equipment. This Knack inspires other Scions as easily as mortals, but it doesn\u2019t inspire titanspawn. Nonetheless, titanspawn are compelled to at least let him \ufb01nish his speech before carrying out whatever they\u2019re up to.",

These perceptions include input from all five senses, though not the character\u2019s subjective reactions to that input. To use this Boon, the Scion must have a picture of her victim, some genetic token of the victim\u2019s (such as a lock of hair or several drops of blood) or something the victim created (from a printed-out email to an ice sculpture). By meditating on the item and relaxing her own perceptions\u2014as well as spending a point of Legend after a successful (Perception + Empathy) roll on the part of her player\u2014the Scion experiences the victim\u2019s perceptions clearly and distinctly. The victim is unaware of the Scion\u2019s attention, but the Scion remains semi-aware of her own surroundings."

When she confronts someone she suspects committed an injustice and accuses that person of having done so, her player rolls (Perception + Empathy). (This roll isn\u2019t modified by supernatural powers or contested by the suspect\u2019s player.) On a success, the Scion can intuitively tell whether the suspect is guilty as charged. A failure yields an indeterminate reading and means that the Scion can\u2019t try to determine the same subject\u2019s guilt for 24 hours. A botch yields a false reading."
