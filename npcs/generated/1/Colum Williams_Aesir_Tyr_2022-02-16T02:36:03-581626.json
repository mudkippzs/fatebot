When she confronts someone she suspects committed an injustice and accuses that person of having done so, her player rolls (Perception + Empathy). (This roll isn\u2019t modified by supernatural powers or contested by the suspect\u2019s player.) On a success, the Scion can intuitively tell whether the suspect is guilty as charged. A failure yields an indeterminate reading and means that the Scion can\u2019t try to determine the same subject\u2019s guilt for 24 hours. A botch yields a false reading."
