                "Only characters whose Boons include the Sky Purview have more freedom to \ufb02aunt the laws of physics. Simply having Epic Strength enables a Scion to perform prodigious leaps that leave mortals standing slack-jawed with wonder. For example, if a Scion has Strength 5, Athletics 3 and Epic Strength 3, she can jump 12 yards straight up or 24 yards forward. (See \u201cMovement\u201d on p. 180\\.) This Knack, however, doubles a Scion\u2019s vertical and horizontal jumping distances. With it, the aforementioned character could leap an amazing 24 yards straight up (from the ground to a seventh-story balcony, for instance) or 48 yards forward in a single bound.",

The Scion gains a number of Legend points equal to the number of successes rolled. The story must pertain specifically to the Scion, which the context should make clear. Also, it must be uttered or written without the Scion\u2019s direct knowledge. He might reasonably expect to see or hear it, but he cannot literally command someone to say or write it so as to reap the benefits.

That plant or patch can then survive for a whole year (or for its whole life if its natural span is shorter) without food or sunlight or water. The Scion\u2019s ministrations keep the plant healthy through drought, nutrient deficiency, unnatural darkness or other environmental shortfall. The plant\u2019s surroundings must be within its natural tolerances for the plant to survive, though. (This Boon can\u2019t nurture seaweed on the desert floor, for instance.) Also, this Boon doesn\u2019t protect against or cure any blight or damage from herbivorous noshing."

She can breathe water as easily as air, and she is neither scalded by boiling water nor subject to debilitating frostbite from ice. Having boiling water poured on one\u2019s flesh still hurts, mind you, and being bound in ice or cast adrift in frigid water can still numb and paralyze a Scion. Neither of those extremes can cause the Scion actual physical damage, though."
