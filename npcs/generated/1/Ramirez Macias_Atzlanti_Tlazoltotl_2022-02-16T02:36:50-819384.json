                "Prerequisite Knack: Charmer (Scion: Hero, p. 130) The demigod\u2019s force of personality is such that he can quell the passion of a seething mob, whether he\u2019s addressing a throng of rowdy political protesters, standing between an innocent kitsune and the lynch mob howling for her hide, or stalling the phalanx of SWAT cops long enough for his partner to \ufb01nish sacri\ufb01cing the hostages. By spending a point of Willpower and Legend, the Scion cools the crowd\u2019s urge for instant action and buys himself enough time to try to talk some sense into everyone. Doing so is primarily a matter of role-playing, but if the player is not as good an extemporaneous speech-maker as his character is, he may roll (Charisma + Presence) to simulate his heartfelt call for calm. His words convince three members of the mob per success on the roll. This effect lasts for the scene, after which the mob either disperses or renews its shenanigans with its original vigor. If the character is attempting to halt the depredations of a mob that is being controlled or directed supernaturally, use of this Knack constitutes an opposed roll against the other power\u2019s activation roll. If the power has no activation roll per se, the Scion\u2019s player rolls his (Charisma + Presence) against that of the character who incited the mob supernaturally. If the Scion with this Knack gets an equal or greater number of successes, the Knack does what it\u2019s supposed to.",

No amount of collapsing rubble can break the Scion\u2019s bones (or the Birthright itself), and he won\u2019t suffocate no matter how much dirt piles onto him. If he lacks the strength to free himself, however, he does run the risk of either starving to death or dying of thirst if no one digs him out. Yet, it would not be the earth that kills him, but his own lack of fortitude."
