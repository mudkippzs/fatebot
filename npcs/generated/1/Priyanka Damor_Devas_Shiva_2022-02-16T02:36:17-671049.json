                "Prerequisite Knack: Devourer (Scion: Demigod, p. 58) A character with Inner Furnace (see Scion: Hero, p. 129) can eat any organic substance and drink water from any source and be efficiently nourished. A character with Devourer can safely eat literally anything she can force down her gullet. With both Knacks, no poison or toxin in what she eats or drinks has any effect on her. Internal Refinery expands that latter protection to not only poisons or toxins she eats, but all poisons and toxins she\u2019s exposed to, as well as any diseases that mortal flesh might suffer. In addition, a character with this Knack can refine any poison, toxin or disease to which she is exposed into a single dose of an antidote for that substance or cure to that affliction. If the character spits this antidote or cure out and administers it to an afflicted patient, it completely erases one dose or one exposure to the hazardous substance in the patient\u2019s system. The character must administer this treatment within one scene of the patient\u2019s exposure, and within one action of when she (the character with this Knack) refines the substance into a dose of its cure. The cure doesn\u2019t heal damage from the exposure, but it purges it completely. Refining the deleterious material costs five Legend points per dose.",

                "Mortal beauty or ugliness can take one\u2019s breath away, but divine beauty or ugliness can do so much more. When a Scion grows angry at a mortal \u2014 such as a tabloid photographer who just won\u2019t leave him alone \u2014 his player can spend a point of Legend and sear his visage into the mortal\u2019s retinas. Doing so blinds and disorients the mortal for the remainder of the scene. If the Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance represents beauty, the victim meanders aimlessly, dazzled by the character\u2019s divine radiance. If the Epic Appearance represents ugliness, the victim staggers around in a blind panic unable to get the awful visage out of his head. Rules for dealing with blindness appear on page 186 of Scion: Hero.",
