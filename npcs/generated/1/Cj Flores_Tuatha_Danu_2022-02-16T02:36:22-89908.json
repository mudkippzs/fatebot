If he can \ufb01nd a location where he is absolutely certain his prey has been within the last 24 hours, he can follow that prey\u2019s trail unerringly no matter where the prey goes. If the prey takes \ufb02ight\u2014either because it\u2019s a bird or because it\u2019s a man with a plane ticket\u2014he can track it through the air. If it swims away in a raging river, he can follow it through the water. If it gets into a car and drives uptown through rush hour traffic, he can retrace its path. Usually, the hardest part of the hunt lies in knowing where to start; after that, it\u2019s just a matter of catching up. The one hitch to using this Knack is that unless the Scion has the next Knack, Telescopic Senses, he must be able to travel within 100 yards of the prey\u2019s path of escape. If the prey \ufb02ies higher, swims deeper or burrows farther than 100 yards from the nearest path the Scion can take to follow, the Scion loses the trail.",

That plant or patch can then survive for a whole year (or for its whole life if its natural span is shorter) without food or sunlight or water. The Scion\u2019s ministrations keep the plant healthy through drought, nutrient deficiency, unnatural darkness or other environmental shortfall.
