The player of a Scion with this Knack spends a point of Legend, and something in the Scion\u2019s bearing or expression convinces a single listener not to dismiss what he\u2019s saying. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that the Scion is taking his words so seriously, or maybe he just has an honest face. Maybe he came highly recommended by a respected colleague. Whatever the reason, the listener gives the Scion the bene\ufb01t of the doubt in regards to what the Scion next tries to explain, despite what he might be otherwise inclined to believe.",

When she confronts someone she suspects committed an injustice and accuses that person of having done so, her player rolls (Perception + Empathy). (This roll isn\u2019t modified by supernatural powers or contested by the suspect\u2019s player.) On a success, the Scion can intuitively tell whether the suspect is guilty as charged. A failure yields an indeterminate reading and means that the Scion can\u2019t try to determine the same subject\u2019s guilt for 24 hours. A botch yields a false reading."
