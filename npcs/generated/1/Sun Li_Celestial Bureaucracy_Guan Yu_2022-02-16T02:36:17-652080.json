With this Knack, a Scion applies this odd philosophy to damage that surprises her. For a single attack that the Scion doesn\u2019t see, hear or otherwise perceive coming, the Scion can spend a point of Legend and a point of Willpower to completely ignore it as if it never happened (thereby suffering no damage from it). Of course the attack does actually happen\u2014any ammunition used is spent, onlookers might be covered with the Scion\u2019s blood, the would-be assassin might be standing right there holding a dripping knife\u2014but such concerns are immaterial to the Scion victim. The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene.",

(Doing so costs one Legend.) Thereafter, whenever that subject is in physical danger (as determined by the Storyteller), the Scion receives a reflexive intuition to that effect.

When she confronts someone she suspects committed an injustice and accuses that person of having done so, her player rolls (Perception + Empathy). (This roll isn\u2019t modified by supernatural powers or contested by the suspect\u2019s player.) On a success, the Scion can intuitively tell whether the suspect is guilty as charged.

The Scion concentrates, touches another character who is using a Boon or spell, and spends a point of Legend. This enhances the target character\u2019s use of the Boon or spell as if his Legend were one higher than its actual value. For instance, a dice pool that included the character\u2019s Legend would gain one die, or the recipient\u2019s Legend would be treated as one higher than its real value (for purposes of Boons whose effectiveness depends on the attacker\u2019s Legend being equal or higher than his target\u2019s)."
