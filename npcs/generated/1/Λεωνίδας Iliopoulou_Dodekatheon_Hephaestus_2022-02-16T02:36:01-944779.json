                "Prerequisite Knack: Holy Rampage (Scion: Hero, p. 126) The raw power of the Scion\u2019s attacks now allows him not only to break through obstacles and walls, but to slam right through armor. The Scion simply channels his legendary might, then uses brute force to shatter enemy defenses and tear through shields, armored plates and vests with ease. While this Knack is active, the Scion\u2019s melee attacks all gain the Piercing quality. Activating this Knack costs five points of Legend. Its effects last for one scene.",

No amount of collapsing rubble can break the Scion\u2019s bones (or the Birthright itself), and he won\u2019t suffocate no matter how much dirt piles onto him. If he lacks the strength to free himself, however, he does run the risk of either starving to death or dying of thirst if no one digs him out. Yet, it would not be the earth that kills him, but his own lack of fortitude."
