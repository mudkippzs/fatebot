                "The Scion\u2019s keen senses allow him to determine when he\u2019s dealing with a creature that has been shape-shifted or a being that has chosen to take on a different form. By spending one point of Legend, the player enables the Scion to discern when any creature that he can sense is actually in a form that is not its default shape. This could be due to a Scion using the Animal Purview to assume an animal form or perhaps the result of a spell, like Circe\u2019s transformative powers (presented in Scion: Demigod, pp. 237-8). The Scion doesn\u2019t necessarily know what the creature\u2019s normal form should be, just that it\u2019s been changed somehow into something different. Of note is the fact that this Knack doesn\u2019t detect illusions: It only determines when a person or creature has physically transformed into something else.",

(Doing so costs one Legend.) Thereafter, whenever that subject is in physical danger (as determined by the Storyteller), the Scion receives a reflexive intuition to that effect.

Also, it must be uttered or written without the Scion\u2019s direct knowledge.
