                "While Relics may be made of stern stuff, the usual off-the-shelf \u201cauthentic katana\u201d tends to fold like the cheap steel that it is when it connects with something under the force of Epic Strength. With this Knack, any tool or item that the Scion picks up benefits from the same bends and loopholes in the laws of physics that allow Epic Strength to defy both leverage and structural integrity. The Scion could use a wooden board to clobber a thug, or he could ram a flimsy iron fireplace poker right through a wall of concrete with the full force of his Epic Strength. In either case, the tool would remain reasonably intact (albeit with some cosmetic wear). Such guarantees are particularly handy when using an object of questionable strength to beat a titanspawn to death without destroying the item in question (such as a snow globe intended as a present). Note that Titanium Tools doesn\u2019t improve the Hardness or rigidity of an item. A cheap katana can still be snapped in half by an angry titanspawn that decides to target the blade. A limp spaghetti noodle is no better a weapon with this Knack than without. Titanium Tools simply allows the Scion to use objects that might be feasible as weapons under normal circumstances and subject them to the extraordinary effects of his Epic Strength without breaking them, for as long as he wields the object.",

These perceptions include input from all five senses, though not the character\u2019s subjective reactions to that input. To use this Boon, the Scion must have a picture of her victim, some genetic token of the victim\u2019s (such as a lock of hair or several drops of blood) or something the victim created (from a printed-out email to an ice sculpture). By meditating on the item and relaxing her own perceptions\u2014as well as spending a point of Legend after a successful (Perception + Empathy) roll on the part of her player\u2014the Scion experiences the victim\u2019s perceptions clearly and distinctly. The victim is unaware of the Scion\u2019s attention, but the Scion remains semi-aware of her own surroundings."
