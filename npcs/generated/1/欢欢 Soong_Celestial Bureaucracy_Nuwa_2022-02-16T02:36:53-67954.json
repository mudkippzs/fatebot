This perspective allows a clear view of a radius in miles equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. The Scion may focus on any point in the reflection and see it clearly, but he can\u2019t see through physical objects or change the angle from the top-down perspective. This Boon doesn\u2019t function on new moon nights, but it can see down through thick clouds on any other night. If the moon is visible during the day, the Scion can use this Boon then as well."

She can breathe water as easily as air, and she is neither scalded by boiling water nor subject to debilitating frostbite from ice. Having boiling water poured on one\u2019s flesh still hurts, mind you, and being bound in ice or cast adrift in frigid water can still numb and paralyze a Scion. Neither of those extremes can cause the Scion actual physical damage, though."

The Scion concentrates, touches another character who is using a Boon or spell, and spends a point of Legend. This enhances the target character\u2019s use of the Boon or spell as if his Legend were one higher than its actual value. For instance, a dice pool that included the character\u2019s Legend would gain one die, or the recipient\u2019s Legend would be treated as one higher than its real value (for purposes of Boons whose effectiveness depends on the attacker\u2019s Legend being equal or higher than his target\u2019s)."
