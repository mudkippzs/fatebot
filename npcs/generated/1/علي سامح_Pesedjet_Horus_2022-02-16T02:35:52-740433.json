                "Prerequisite Knack: Holy Rampage (Scion: Hero, p. 126) The raw power of the Scion\u2019s attacks now allows him not only to break through obstacles and walls, but to slam right through armor. The Scion simply channels his legendary might, then uses brute force to shatter enemy defenses and tear through shields, armored plates and vests with ease. While this Knack is active, the Scion\u2019s melee attacks all gain the Piercing quality. Activating this Knack costs five points of Legend. Its effects last for one scene.",

This perspective allows a clear view of a radius in miles equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. The Scion may focus on any point in the reflection and see it clearly, but he can\u2019t see through physical objects or change the angle from the top-down perspective. This Boon doesn\u2019t function on new moon nights, but it can see down through thick clouds on any other night. If the moon is visible during the day, the Scion can use this Boon then as well."

When she confronts someone she suspects committed an injustice and accuses that person of having done so, her player rolls (Perception + Empathy). (This roll isn\u2019t modified by supernatural powers or contested by the suspect\u2019s player.) On a success, the Scion can intuitively tell whether the suspect is guilty as charged. A failure yields an indeterminate reading and means that the Scion can\u2019t try to determine the same subject\u2019s guilt for 24 hours. A botch yields a false reading."
