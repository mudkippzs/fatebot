                "The Scion\u2019s body is so tough that, even unarmed, he can parry close-combat attacks that would in\ufb02ict lethal damage. If a berserker hopped up on Jotunblut or a thrall full of eitr tries to split the Scion\u2019s skull with a \ufb01 re ax, the Scion can take the blow on his forearm and knock it aside without serious injury. (That assumes the character\u2019s Parry DV is suf\ufb01cient to cancel out the attack roll\u2019s successes, of course.) While that bene\ufb01t remains in effect all the time, the Scion can also engage a temporary one that offers even more protection. With the expenditure of a Legend point, a measure of the Scion\u2019s ichor wells up from within and coats the Scion\u2019s body. This coating hardens into a gleaming, metallic armor that\u2019s no thicker than a hair\u2019s breadth. This armor has a bashing and lethal soak equal to the character\u2019s Legend, and it in\ufb02icts a mobility penalty of only -1. The ichor coating is thin enough to \ufb01 t comfortably beneath one\u2019s clothing, so it adds its protective value to that of any other armor the character might already be wearing. Natural armor from this Knack lasts for only one scene and disintegrates at the scene\u2019s end.",

That plant or patch can then survive for a whole year (or for its whole life if its natural span is shorter) without food or sunlight or water. The Scion\u2019s ministrations keep the plant healthy through drought, nutrient deficiency, unnatural darkness or other environmental shortfall. The plant\u2019s surroundings must be within its natural tolerances for the plant to survive, though. (This Boon can\u2019t nurture seaweed on the desert floor, for instance.) Also, this Boon doesn\u2019t protect against or cure any blight or damage from herbivorous noshing."

Her prediction is good up to a number of days in advance equal to the successes scored by her player on the initial (Intelligence + Science) roll. This doesn\u2019t account for changes introduced by more powerful uses of the Sky Purview or by Titans and titanspawn."

She can either radiate a glow from her entire body, shining with the intensity of a 100-watt incandescent light bulb, or focus that light to a narrower beam. For instance, she could narrow the focus of the light to come from her palm or her eyes to act as a high-powered flashlight. The Scion can emit soft light thus for one scene."

The player rolls (Stamina + Survival) and spends one Legend, and any blight or infestation ends immediately. Blight clears up as if it had never occurred, and vermin suddenly find the affected plants unappealing. This Boon affects a number of large plants (or a number of square yards of a patch of smaller plants) equal to the successes achieved on the roll. This Boon doesn\u2019t protect against future blights, and it stops only the current generation of vermin infestation."
