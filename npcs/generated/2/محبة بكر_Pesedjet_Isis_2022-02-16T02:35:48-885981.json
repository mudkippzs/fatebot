                "Prerequisite Knack: Blessing of Importance (Scion: Hero, p. 130) A heroic Scion with Epic Charisma can help restore a mortal\u2019s sense of self worth and empowerment just by paying a bit of attention to him and making him feel special. The charismatic Scion can even replenish a measure of the same for one of his fellow Scions. A demigod Scion\u2019s attention makes a person feel even more important, though, especially when the Scion goes out of his way to treat the person like a true friend. When the demigod does so (and spends a point of Legend), he completely re\ufb01 lls a fellow Scion\u2019s spent Willpower points (if that amount is higher than the charismatic Scion\u2019s Epic Charisma). Should he treat a mortal with such affection, the mortal not only regains all his spent Willpower, as per Blessing of Importance, he gains an extra dot of Willpower for the scene. When that extra dot goes away at the end of the scene, the mortal\u2019s spent Willpower completely replenishes again. The Scion can affect a person only once per scene with this Knack.",

                "Prerequisite Knack: Overt Order (Scion: Hero, p. 131) With a moment of eye contact and the expenditure of a Willpower point, the Scion instantly plunges a mortal into a hypnotic trance. Attempting to hypnotize a fellow Scion of lesser or equal (Willpower + Legend) requires not only a Willpower expenditure but a (Manipulation + Command + Legend) roll contested against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). Scions cannot instantly hypnotize fellow Scions of higher (Willpower + Legend). Should he successfully hypnotize a victim, the Scion can implant one hidden command that the victim must obey at the time of the Scion\u2019s choosing. The command must be something that the victim can accomplish in one scene, and the trigger condition that compels him to attempt it must occur within a number of months equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. The Scion can give as speci\ufb01c an order as he pleases, and a mortal cannot interpret it in any way other than the spirit in which it was intended. A fellow Scion can interpret it loosely to his own advantage, as per Overt Order, but doing so costs him a point of Willpower. The victim remains unaware of the ticking time bomb in his subconscious, but he does have a chance to resist it when the trigger condition occurs. At the moment when he has been commanded to perform the action in question, the victim\u2019s player may make a (Wits + Integrity) roll. (This roll cannot be modi\ufb01ed by a Scion\u2019s Epic Wits or an Integrity Arete.) If the roll garners more successes than the hypnotist Scion has dots of Legend, the compulsion is broken. If the last-minute resistance roll fails, the victim must attempt to do as he was commanded. Whether he succeeds or fails, the compulsion ends after he makes the attempt, and he has no memory of what could possibly have convinced him to do as he did.",

The player rolls (Stamina + Survival) and spends one Legend, and any blight or infestation ends immediately. Blight clears up as if it had never occurred, and vermin suddenly find the affected plants unappealing. This Boon affects a number of large plants (or a number of square yards of a patch of smaller plants) equal to the successes achieved on the roll. This Boon doesn\u2019t protect against future blights, and it stops only the current generation of vermin infestation."

The line can be as long as the Scion wishes to make it, so long as she traces the entire line in one pass. At the end, she names a creature. This can be as specific or as general as she wishes: \u201ctitanspawn,\u201d \u201cmortals,\u201d \u201cany animal smaller than a rat\u201d and \u201cKane Taoka\u201d are all valid examples. If a creature of that sort crosses the line, the Scion immediately becomes aware of it. There\u2019s no limit to the number of Warning Lines that a Scion can have drawn at once, and she can intuitively tell the difference between any of them. (That is, if she has three different Warning Lines active, she knows which one was tripped at any given time). A Warning Line remains effective for a number of days equal to the player\u2019s activation roll."

That plant or patch can then survive for a whole year (or for its whole life if its natural span is shorter) without food or sunlight or water. The Scion\u2019s ministrations keep the plant healthy through drought, nutrient deficiency, unnatural darkness or other environmental shortfall. The plant\u2019s surroundings must be within its natural tolerances for the plant to survive, though. (This Boon can\u2019t nurture seaweed on the desert floor, for instance.) Also, this Boon doesn\u2019t protect against or cure any blight or damage from herbivorous noshing."
