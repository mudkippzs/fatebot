If an enemy\u2019s attack against the Scion in\ufb02icts enough damage to cause knockback, the Scion may spend a point of Legend and a point of Willpower to re\ufb02exively negate all damage from the attack. The attack still in\ufb02icts its knockback, though, seemingly knocking the Scion completely out of his skin. The empty husk collapses at the attacker\u2019s feet, disintegrating over three ticks. The Scion who was apparently knocked out of his skin lands perfectly unharmed however far away the knockback threw him, retaining all of his clothing and possessions and radiating a golden sheen until the shed skin disintegrates. The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene.",

She still can\u2019t harm the fragile ectoplasmic shell of a ghost who hasn\u2019t manifested, however. The sense of touch this Boon grants is illusory.

Blight clears up as if it had never occurred, and vermin suddenly find the affected plants unappealing. This Boon affects a number of large plants (or a number of square yards of a patch of smaller plants) equal to the successes achieved on the roll. This Boon doesn\u2019t protect against future blights, and it stops only the current generation of vermin infestation."

This can be as specific or as general as she wishes: \u201ctitanspawn,\u201d \u201cmortals,\u201d \u201cany animal smaller than a rat\u201d and \u201cKane Taoka\u201d are all valid examples. If a creature of that sort crosses the line, the Scion immediately becomes aware of it. There\u2019s no limit to the number of Warning Lines that a Scion can have drawn at once, and she can intuitively tell the difference between any of them.
