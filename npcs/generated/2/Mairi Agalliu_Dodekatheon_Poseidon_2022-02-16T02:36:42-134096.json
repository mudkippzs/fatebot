If he\u2019s looking for something specific in the earth\u2014such as gold, oil or a human body\u2014this Boon reveals its distance from him and depth from the epicenter at the expense of the other information. The Boon works only at ground level or on the up-thrust surface of a mountainside, but it works through floors and pavement. It gives the Scion a semispherical reading with a radius equal to one half mile per dot of Legend."

Potability allows the Scion to touch one source of water no larger than a bathtub and cause any liquid in it to become safe to drink. While various contaminants may remain, including living beings, the water will not be poisonous or disease-laden. It might be brown, it might have algae floating on top, and it might taste like dirt mixed with baking soda, but it\u2019ll quench thirst and function for irrigation, if necessary."
