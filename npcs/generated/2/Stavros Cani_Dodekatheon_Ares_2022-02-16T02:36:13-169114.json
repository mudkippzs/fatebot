                "Although the Water Purview can provide protection against the deep pressure of the ocean, and the Earth purview can likewise defend against the crushing weight of being buried, some Scions just don\u2019t have the luxury of branching out into multiple Purviews like that \u2014 or, worse still, fnd themselves in the awkward position of being stuck in a Titan\u2019s gullet, a hyperbaric chamber or an otherworldly place of super-thick atmosphere. Fortunately, a Scion with this Knack need not fear the punishment of changes in pressure or atmosphere. While the Scion must still breathe, she doesn\u2019t have to worry about the bends, explosive decompression or the crushing force of a deep undersea trench. Her body naturally and instinctively adjusts to account for all changes in pressure. Under Pressure can\u2019t protect a Scion against bruising and crushing damage: If she\u2019s stuck in the aforementioned Titanic gullet, she\u2019ll have to use other abilities to deal with the digestive action and the acid. She won\u2019t, however, have to worry about suddenly being crushed when submerged deep in that same pool of stomach acid."

Every fighter on the Scion\u2019s enemies\u2019 side who hears the unearthly shriek loses one die from all attack rolls for a number of attacks equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend rating."

Every character on the Scion\u2019s side of the conflict who hears the benediction gains a point of Willpower as well as two temporary bonus dots of Valor that last until the battle ends. The Scion may amplify his voice electronically, but he must be present at the battle and give the blessing live."
