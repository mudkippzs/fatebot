Finally, if the subject is Fatebound to someone and is acting out a Fatebound Role, he can figure out what that role is.

To use it, she accuses the guilty party of the injustice (be it in person, in a letter, over the phone, via skywriting\u2026), and her player spends a point of Legend and rolls (Manipulation + Integrity).
