Whether she beckons across a crowded room, emails a picture of herself along with an invitation or sends a picture message from her phone with the text caption \u201cGYAOH,\u201d the object of her desire makes all due haste to reach her. The Scion\u2019s player spends a Legend point, and she must single out one recipient at a time. The intended target must be able to see an image of the Scion, he must understand that the message is intended for him, and he must have a reasonable idea of how to \ufb01nd her. Scions whose Epic Appearance represents divine ugliness cannot use this Knack. Also, it doesn\u2019t work on beautiful Scions with more dots of Epic Appearance than the one using the Knack.",

When she confronts someone she suspects committed an injustice and accuses that person of having done so, her player rolls (Perception + Empathy). (This roll isn\u2019t modified by supernatural powers or contested by the suspect\u2019s player.) On a success, the Scion can intuitively tell whether the suspect is guilty as charged. A failure yields an indeterminate reading and means that the Scion can\u2019t try to determine the same subject\u2019s guilt for 24 hours. A botch yields a false reading."

To use it, she accuses the guilty party of the injustice (be it in person, in a letter, over the phone, via skywriting\u2026), and her player spends a point of Legend and rolls (Manipulation + Integrity). If the roll succeeds, the accusation causes the victim to periodically hallucinate like Macbeth or his wife. These hallucinations occur randomly, torturing the guilty party with the knowledge that justice hasn\u2019t been served. They also render him unable to regain Willpower."
