This immunity remains in effect regardless of what substance is burning. It doesn\u2019t, however, extend to his clothes or to any item except the Birthright through which he channels the Boon."

With this Boon, a Scion removes both necessities from a single flame for one scene. He could keep a single torch (or even a match) lit for hours as he explores a dark labyrinth. He could cause the tiny spark at the end of a fuse to burn in place without moving. This Boon is also good for keeping a source of flame from consuming the breathable air in an enclosed space."

She is miraculously untouched in the confusion, and she remains so for as long as she doesn\u2019t actively involve herself. She still suffers normal environmental movement penalties, but environmental dangers such as falling rocks, stampeding beasts or thrashing rioters all fail to touch her."
