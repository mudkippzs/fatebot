                "Prerequisite Knack: Inspirational Figure (Scion: Hero, p. 130) When a demigod has a willing audience, he can inspire every member with an uplifting, well-intentioned speech or sermon. This Knack works exactly as its prerequisite, and functions under the same limitations, but it is more effective. Mortals and Scions who hear it are so inspired that their spent Willpower points are entirely re\ufb01lled. This Knack also has a more insidious dimension. If the Scion \ufb01nds himself in charge of a group of titanspawn, he can spend a point of Willpower and give those awful minions a speech that empowers them just as Inspirational Figure inspires mortals. Each titanspawn who hears him regains a point of spent Willpower. Scions who might be opposed to the titanspawn\u2019s goals don\u2019t receive any bene\ufb01t from this inspirational speech, but they are compelled to let the demigod \ufb01nish what he has to say before they do something about it.",

To use this Boon, the Scion must have a picture of her victim, some genetic token of the victim\u2019s (such as a lock of hair or several drops of blood) or something the victim created (from a printed-out email to an ice sculpture). By meditating on the item and relaxing her own perceptions\u2014as well as spending a point of Legend after a successful (Perception + Empathy) roll on the part of her player\u2014the Scion experiences the victim\u2019s perceptions clearly and distinctly.
