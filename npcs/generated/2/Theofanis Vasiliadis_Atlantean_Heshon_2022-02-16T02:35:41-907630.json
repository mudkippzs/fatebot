The player rolls (Stamina + Survival) and spends one Legend, and any blight or infestation ends immediately. Blight clears up as if it had never occurred, and vermin suddenly find the affected plants unappealing. This Boon affects a number of large plants (or a number of square yards of a patch of smaller plants) equal to the successes achieved on the roll. This Boon doesn\u2019t protect against future blights, and it stops only the current generation of vermin infestation."

The revelation should be something simple like \u201copening the parrot cage,\u201d \u201cstaying in the hallway,\u201d \u201cwinking at the Scion of Sif\u201d or \u201ccalling the Scion of Ptah\u2019s cell phone.\u201d The Storyteller should explain only which action will lead to which outcome, not how."
