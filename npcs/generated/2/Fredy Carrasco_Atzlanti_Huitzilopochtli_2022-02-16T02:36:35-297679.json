                "Prerequisite Knack: Inspirational Figure (Scion: Hero, p. 130) The Scion spends a minute giving a brief inspirational speech, then charges ahead into the fray (be it fighting titanspawn or heading to the lab to find a last-ditch cure for a Titan-created plague). The Scion\u2019s player spends two points of Legend and rolls (Charisma + Command + Legend). For each success scored, one person in the crowd becomes fired up with the Scion\u2019s Virtue. The mortal listener gains one dot in a Virtue that the Scion possesses \u2014 whichever one the provided speech was about. This can lead mortals into all the benefits and pitfalls of having a Virtue rating. Every listener gains the same Virtue. A Scion could choose to give a Virtue that won\u2019t have any direct benefit on an upcoming action, if they so desire. The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene.",

Every character on the Scion\u2019s side of the conflict who hears the benediction gains a point of Willpower as well as two temporary bonus dots of Valor that last until the battle ends. The Scion may amplify his voice electronically, but he must be present at the battle and give the blessing live."

To her, ghosts are livid, physical presences, sensible to feeling as to sight (as well as smell and hearing). She still can\u2019t harm the fragile ectoplasmic shell of a ghost who hasn\u2019t manifested, however. The sense of touch this Boon grants is illusory. If the Scion tries to exert enough pressure to cause damage or restrain the ghost, her hand passes through it."

The task cannot seem suicidal or impossible to the animal, but the animal cannot balk at an order that doesn\u2019t immediately seem so. \u201cHey rabbit, go rip that lion\u2019s throat open,\u201d would seem impossible to the rabbit so commanded. \u201cRun to that grass across this street,\u201d would be a fine order for that same rabbit, though, even if cars were zipping by. The order can describe a single immediate action (\u201cBite that guy!\u201d) or one with a single condition (\u201cCome find me when a blue car stops here.\u201d). If he lacks the previous Boon, the Scion can deliver his command only through simplistic nonverbal signals."

The item in question is immune for a number of days equal to the threshold successes scored by the player on the (Intelligence + Medicine) roll. Scions using the Death Purview extensively find this Boon extremely handy in keeping their various cadaverous \u201cfriends\u201d fresh and crisp."

This Boon doesn\u2019t make animals smart, calm or loyal, but most are curious enough about having a person address them that they\u2019ll hear a Scion out before defaulting to aggression, panic or indifference."
