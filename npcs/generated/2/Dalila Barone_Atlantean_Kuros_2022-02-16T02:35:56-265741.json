                "If a character has no aptitude for a particular Ability (i.e., no dots in it), he cannot apply any bonus successes from his Epic Attributes to rolls that use that Ability. He simply doesn\u2019t understand enough about what he\u2019s doing to apply his full talent. With this Knack, however, the character gets a feel for any activity remarkably quickly. As such, he can apply some of his appropriate Epic Attribute bonus to the appropriate roll, despite the fact that he has no dots in the relevant Ability. In such a circumstance, a player can enhance a roll with this Knack and add a number of bonus successes from his character\u2019s Epic Attribute equal to the number of dots he has in the Epic Attribute. Enhancing a roll with this Knack\u2019s benefit costs two Legend points.",
