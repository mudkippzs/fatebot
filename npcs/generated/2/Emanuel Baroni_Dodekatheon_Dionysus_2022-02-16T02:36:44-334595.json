                "The character rarely lacks for sustenance. As long as he can \ufb01nd some sort of organic substance (from rotting quail eggs to a piece of notebook paper on which someone blew her nose), the Scion can eat it and survive. And as long as he \ufb01nds a source of water (no matter how stagnant or polluted it might be), he can drink it and survive. Any pestilence or poison lurking in what he consumes burns in the \ufb01res of his superior constitution, without even requiring a Fortitude roll. The same goes for drugs or poisons he ingests on purpose, or for any Mickey Finn a ne\u2019er-do-well might try to slip him. He\u2019s still just as susceptible to airborne toxins and any drug injected into his bloodstream, but any drug that has to go through his stomach \ufb01rst stops there. This Knack does nothing to suppress the gag re\ufb02ex or make an unappetizing meal taste better.",

That plant or patch can then survive for a whole year (or for its whole life if its natural span is shorter) without food or sunlight or water. The Scion\u2019s ministrations keep the plant healthy through drought, nutrient deficiency, unnatural darkness or other environmental shortfall. The plant\u2019s surroundings must be within its natural tolerances for the plant to survive, though. (This Boon can\u2019t nurture seaweed on the desert floor, for instance.) Also, this Boon doesn\u2019t protect against or cure any blight or damage from herbivorous noshing."
