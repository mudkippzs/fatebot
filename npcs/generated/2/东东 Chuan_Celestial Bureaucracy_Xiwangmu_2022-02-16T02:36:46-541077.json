                "This Knack magnifies the time a Scion can hold her breath. After inhaling deeply and expending a point of Legend, the Scion can triple the duration she can hold her breath after calculating extended duration due to Epic Stamina. In addition, she becomes immune to pressure changes that come from diving to extreme depths underwater. This Knack doesn\u2019t affect swimming speeds, visibility or other aspects of moving underwater. As a useful side effect, a Scion using this Knack has such great breath control that she can speak when underwater (or otherwise holding her breath) by releasing only a minimal amount of air. The character can easily manage short sentences and brief conversations. Extended speech, such as giving an academic lecture while underwater, is either too difficult or at least would drastically reduce the time the Scion can hold her breath (at the discretion of the Storyteller). This Knack also makes combat underwater much easier, since being struck or injured cannot cause the Scion to lose her breath unless someone makes a deliberate effort to squeeze the air from her lungs.",

When he joins battle, his player can either make a Join Battle roll like everyone else, or he can simply spend a point of Legend for his character to automatically go \ufb01rst in the reaction count. This Knack cannot automatically preempt an otherwise unexpected attack, though, as the character must actually be able to join battle for this Knack to function. If more than one character involved in a combat scene has this Knack, the character with the highest (Wits + Epic Wits) total goes \ufb01rst. If characters with this Knack have equal totals, default to a separate Join Battle roll to see which of them acts \ufb01rst.",

To use it, she accuses the guilty party of the injustice (be it in person, in a letter, over the phone, via skywriting\u2026), and her player spends a point of Legend and rolls (Manipulation + Integrity). If the roll succeeds, the accusation causes the victim to periodically hallucinate like Macbeth or his wife.

For instance, a dice pool that included the character\u2019s Legend would gain one die, or the recipient\u2019s Legend would be treated as one higher than its real value (for purposes of Boons whose effectiveness depends on the attacker\u2019s Legend being equal or higher than his target\u2019s)."
