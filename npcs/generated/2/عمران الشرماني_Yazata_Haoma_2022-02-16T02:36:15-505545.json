                "Prerequisite Knack: Hurl to the Horizon (Scion: Hero, p. 126) This Knack automatically triples the distance a demigod Scion can throw a heavy object as a feat of strength. That tripling comes not only after the modi\ufb01cation based on the character\u2019s Epic Strength but also after the doubling provided by the prerequisite Knack. (In effect, it multiplies his feat-of-strength throwing distance by six.) Using this Knack costs a point of Legend. Mighty Heave does not affect the distance a Scion can throw a normal-sized object, but it does intensify the damage such an object can cause. Thrown weapons or other thrown items that would normally cause bashing damage (a coconut, for example) in\ufb02ict lethal damage and take on the Piercing quality instead when the Scion uses Mighty Heave. Items that would normally cause lethal damage still cause only lethal damage, but they ignore armor when the Scion uses Mighty Heave.",

That plant or patch can then survive for a whole year (or for its whole life if its natural span is shorter) without food or sunlight or water. The Scion\u2019s ministrations keep the plant healthy through drought, nutrient deficiency, unnatural darkness or other environmental shortfall. The plant\u2019s surroundings must be within its natural tolerances for the plant to survive, though. (This Boon can\u2019t nurture seaweed on the desert floor, for instance.) Also, this Boon doesn\u2019t protect against or cure any blight or damage from herbivorous noshing."

(Or writing, or signing \u2014 just so long as the target can understand the Scion.) The dot must be in one of the two categories chosen by the Scion. There is no repeat use to grant multiple dots (even in multiple categories). The gift of power can raise Epic Attributes above the limits set by the target\u2019s Legend, and each gift costs as many Legend points as the resulting Epic Attribute rating. This power can affect mortals as well as Scions and other supernatural folk. The effect lasts for a scene."
