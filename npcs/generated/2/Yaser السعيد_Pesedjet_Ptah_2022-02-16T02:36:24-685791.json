With this Boon, a Scion removes both necessities from a single flame for one scene. He could keep a single torch (or even a match) lit for hours as he explores a dark labyrinth. He could cause the tiny spark at the end of a fuse to burn in place without moving. This Boon is also good for keeping a source of flame from consuming the breathable air in an enclosed space."

With this Boon, he channels that powerful light through his gaze to intimidate a foe. Such a foe can be an animal, a person, a Scion or even one of the titanspawn, and the Scion need only look it in the eyes and spend a point of Legend. An animal who sees the Sekem Blaze in the Scion\u2019s eyes immediately ceases any aggression toward the Scion and flees. A mortal or ghost so affected calms down and remains cowed for the rest of the scene."
