Her body naturally and instinctively adjusts to account for all changes in pressure.

For the rest of the scene, the distances the Scion can move or dash per action remain normal, but they now apply to the Z-axis as well as the X- and Y-axes. All the normal rules for movement remain in place, except that the character can now move freely through all three dimensions (i.e., he can fly). He can even hold still in midair if he wants to. The only thing a character can\u2019t do in midair that he could do on the ground is jump, as there\u2019s nothing to jump off of."

Alternatively, the Scion can use that point to double the distance he can jump either straight up or horizontally.

Doing so requires one Legend point per action, and the Scion\u2019s player rolls (Wits + Brawl) to direct the winds. This roll functions just as the normal roll for a clinch attack, contested against the defender\u2019s efforts as normal. If his attack succeeds, the Scion may do with his victim as any successful grappler can do with a subdued victim, from pinning him to crushing him to throwing him. The attacker cannot apply any bonus dice or Knacks from his Epic Strength in these grappling maneuvers."

To use it, the Scion raises a hand heavenward or points his Birthright weapon at his intended foe. At his behest, lightning either lances down from the sky or launches from the weapon itself to smite the victim. Each such bolt inflicts 15 dice of lethal damage plus extra successes on the Marksmanship roll. An attack that inflicts damage also inflicts knockdown or knockback automatically."

Using this Boon adds a number of levels of damage equal to the character\u2019s Legend to the damage roll\u2019s results before soak.
