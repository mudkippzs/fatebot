            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Control \nCost: 1 Willpower \nThe Scion can now exert some control over a victim whose senses she\u2019s observing. The Scion must be actively experiencing her victim\u2019s perceptions with Rada\u2019s Eyes, and her player must spend a Willpower point to activate this Boon. If the Voodoo Scion\u2019s victim is a mortal or a Scion with fewer dots of Legend than she has, activating this Boon takes only that Willpower expenditure. If the Scion victim has an equal number of Legend dots, the Voodoo Scion\u2019s player must also succeed in a contested roll of her (Intelligence + Control) against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend)."

            "Wind Grapple",
            "Dice Pool: Wits + Brawl \nCost: 1 Legend per action \nBy directing freak gusts of wind and the airborne detritus that collects in them, the Scion can wrestle with opponents without even touching them. Doing so requires one Legend point per action, and the Scion\u2019s player rolls (Wits + Brawl) to direct the winds. This roll functions just as the normal roll for a clinch attack, contested against the defender\u2019s efforts as normal. If his attack succeeds, the Scion may do with his victim as any successful grappler can do with a subdued victim, from pinning him to crushing him to throwing him. The attacker cannot apply any bonus dice or Knacks from his Epic Strength in these grappling maneuvers."
