            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Integrity \nCost: 1 Willpower + 5 Legend \nThe Amesha Spenta are six principles that represent aspects of the old Persian understanding of the World. For each level of this Boon, the Scion selects an additional Amesha Spenta. \nA mystic aura surrounds a Scion who invokes an Amesha Spenta. The Scion gains a benefit to one of her purviews. If the Scion currently lacks a suitable Birthright for channeling that purview, she can invoke the Boons she knows anyway, at no penalty. (She still needs to own a suitable Birthright and learn Boons as normal: Amesha Spenta Yasht merely offers a chance to channel the purview if the Birthright is unavailable.) If the Scion has her Birthright, then she gains bonus dice equal to her Legend on rolls to activate Boons from that purview. \nThe Scion may only invoke one aura per scene, but the Boon lasts for the remainder of the scene or until the Scion chooses to end it. \n\u2022 Ameretat \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Eternal Life. Associated with all plant life, this Amesha Spenta manifests as a faint shimmer of a green aura surrounding the Scion, twisting at the edges like a vine\u2019s tendrils. Ameretat is associated with the purview of Fertility. \n\u2022 Armaiti \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Holy Devotion. Armaiti is associated with the earth, and appears as a brown or beige aura around the Scion, crumbling at the edges into motes that fall and swirl back into the aura like a trickle of sand. Armaiti is associated with the purview of Earth. \n\u2022 Asha Vahishta \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Best Truth. A red-orange aura flares to life around the Scion, flickering at the edges like flames. Asha Vahishta is associated with the purview of Fire. \n\u2022 Haurvetat \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Perfect Wholeness. Associated with the waters of the world, this Amesha Spenta manifests as a light blue aura in constant motion, flowing smoothly across the Scion\u2019s features. Haurvetat is associated with the purview of Water. \n\u2022 Kshathra \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Righteous Dominion. Kshathra is associated with the sky and metals, and appears as a silver-white aura that flashes with angles and edges. Kshathra is associated with the purview of Sky. \n\u2022 Vohu Manah \u2014 The Amesha Spenta of Good Wisdom. No aura appears, but the Scion\u2019s features take an ever-changing animalistic cast \u2014 her eyes might become cat-like one moment, or her skin may seem scaled the next. Vohu Manah is associated with the Animal purview."

            "Dice Pool: Wits + Empathy \nCost: 1 Willpower \nThis Boon turns a person\u2019s rational thoughts into seething, chaotic noise. On a successful activation roll, the victim freezes in place, suddenly unable to think, speak or act. He\u2019s unaware of what goes on around him, and he has no memory of the moments before or after the use of this Boon. The effect lasts for a number of actions equal to the successes on the activation roll, and it erases the victim\u2019s memory for an equal amount of time before the roll. If the victim has more dots of Legend than the user, the power doesn\u2019t work. If the victim has an equal Legend rating, the activation roll is contested against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend)."

To use it, the Scion raises a hand heavenward or points his Birthright weapon at his intended foe. At his behest, lightning either lances down from the sky or launches from the weapon itself to smite the victim. Each such bolt inflicts 15 dice of lethal damage plus extra successes on the Marksmanship roll. An attack that inflicts damage also inflicts knockdown or knockback automatically."

Yazata traditionally choose Sun, to improve their connection to Divine Light, or Stars, the purview of cosmic order \u2014 but they can choose anything. However, a character can only do this once: She cannot go on to create further Amesha Spentas. A Yazata\u2019s personal Amesha Spenta has the same effects as the basic six, with the same cost to manifest.
