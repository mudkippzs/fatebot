In so doing, she gains a dice bonus equal to the number of Legend points she spends on the effect, which lasts for a number of days equal to number of successes on the activation roll. Be it anything from a weapon to a baby grand piano, the item must be one that requires a dice roll to use with skill. If the character uses this Boon on one of her Birthright items, she can enhance only its mundane function."

For the rest of the scene, the distances the Scion can move or dash per action remain normal, but they now apply to the Z-axis as well as the X- and Y-axes. All the normal rules for movement remain in place, except that the character can now move freely through all three dimensions (i.e., he can fly). He can even hold still in midair if he wants to. The only thing a character can\u2019t do in midair that he could do on the ground is jump, as there\u2019s nothing to jump off of."
