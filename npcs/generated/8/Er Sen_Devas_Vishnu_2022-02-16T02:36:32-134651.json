            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Survival \nCost: 2 Legend \nThe Scion imagines a specific shape she wants the nearby plant life to take, and her will makes it so. On a successful (Intelligence + Survival) roll, the Scion affects a number of large plants (or a number of square yards of a patch of smaller plants) equal to the successes the roll achieved. Before her eyes, the plants bend as her imagination desires and set in the new arrangement\u2014 after which they continue to grow as normal. The Scion can\u2019t move the plants around fast enough or with enough finesse to attack people, but she can weave them into bindings or cages to hold people who aren\u2019t moving."
