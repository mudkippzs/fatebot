            "Animal Aspect",
            "Dice Pool: Stamina + Animal Ken \nCost: 1 Legend per action \nBy meditating for one action (Speed 3) on a token representing his animal, the Scion takes on a metaphorical characteristic associated with it, creating a dice bonus for rolls involving the Attribute most closely associated with that characteristic. A Scion might take on a snake\u2019s sinuous grace (Dexterity), a peacock\u2019s beauty (Appearance), an elephant\u2019s proverbial memory (via Intelligence) or any other justifiable characteristic. The bonus dice are equal to the number of successes on the activation roll, and the benefit lasts for one action per Legend point spent up front to fuel the Boon."

            "Warrior Ideal",
            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Presence \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion adopts some idealized warrior aspect, from howling berserker to unquestioning enlisted man to fearless officer to pitiless samurai. This attitude unnerves and intimidates any opponent who faces him in combat, inflicting a penalty equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend on any attack roll the opponent makes. This penalty applies to any character with a lesser or equal Legend rating who attempts to attack the Scion. This idealized aspect lasts for a number of consecutive actions during the battle equal to the successes the Scion\u2019s player rolled to activate it, and he can invoke it only once during any given battle."
