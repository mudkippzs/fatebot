Attempting to hypnotize a fellow Scion of lesser or equal (Willpower + Legend) requires not only a Willpower expenditure but a (Manipulation + Command + Legend) roll contested against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). Scions cannot instantly hypnotize fellow Scions of higher (Willpower + Legend). Should he successfully hypnotize a victim, the Scion can implant one hidden command that the victim must obey at the time of the Scion\u2019s choosing. The command must be something that the victim can accomplish in one scene, and the trigger condition that compels him to attempt it must occur within a number of months equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. The Scion can give as speci\ufb01c an order as he pleases, and a mortal cannot interpret it in any way other than the spirit in which it was intended. A fellow Scion can interpret it loosely to his own advantage, as per Overt Order, but doing so costs him a point of Willpower.

Yet, while the rider has access to her victim\u2019s conscious thoughts, she garners only what context those thoughts provide. She can\u2019t snoop around in the victim\u2019s memory to make sense of an enigmatic reaction. While using Rada\u2019s Eyes, the Scion need only spend an additional point of Legend in order to listen in on the host\u2019s thoughts."

            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Craft \nCost: 3 Legend \nWith a shouted word, a Scion can cause an area in his line of sight to instantly burst into flame. The flame has the intensity of a bonfire, and it covers an area with a radius in yards equal to the number of successes on the activation roll. The flames stand as high from a flat surface as the Scion is tall. This fire can burn without fuel for a number of minutes equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. When that time is up, the flames go out if they still don\u2019t have any fuel. People who are within the area the Scion intends to set alight get a single chance to escape the affected area unharmed before the fire starts. To do so, their players must get more successes on a (Dexterity + Athletics) roll than the Scion\u2019s player got on the activation roll, and the character must be able to get out of the area in one action."

For each point of Legend and Willpower spent, the Scion\u2019s player can choose to affect one weapon. Each weapon blessed with Mortal Stroke inflicts aggravated damage on its next attack."

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend per weapon \nThe Scion reaches into a flame that\u2019s at least as big as a campfire and pulls out a blazing melee weapon made of flickering fire. The weapon can be of any shape and size, but the distinction is largely a matter of personal taste, rather than available traits. These weapons do not use the normal traits from the chart in Scion: Hero. Instead, when the character removes the weapon from the fire, the player receives a base number of points equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend for each weapon. These points can add to a base Accuracy +0, Damage +0 and Defense -1, and they can subtract from a starting Speed 6 (reducing it to a minimum of 1). The player assigns the weapon\u2019s traits as the character produces the weapon, and he can\u2019t change them afterward."

The Scion must somehow incapacitate the victim\u2014by tying him up, drugging him, beating him unconscious or whatever\u2014then cover the victim\u2019s mouth with her own and take a long, deep breath. The victim\u2019s player then rolls (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) against the activation roll. If the activation roll wins, the Scion sucks out the victim\u2019s spirit and swallows it down into the darkness within her. Once that happens, the victim maintains a dreamlike semi-awareness of what the Scion is doing, just as a victim of Horse (Cheval 3) does, but he can\u2019t take any actions or exert his own will in any way."
