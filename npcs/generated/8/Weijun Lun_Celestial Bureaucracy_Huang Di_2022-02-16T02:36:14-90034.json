With a few well-chosen words to reinforce the subject\u2019s awareness of the situation, though, a Scion with this Knack can help people snap out of the unnatural influence of others. The player spends Legend equal to the cost of the power being countered plus one (plus an additional three Legend for every point of Willpower spent on the power being countered), then rolls (Manipulation + Presence + Legend). If the player rolls more successes than the original command, the subject immediately snaps out of it and realizes that he didn\u2019t want to do whatever it is that he was compelled to do. If the original power didn\u2019t require a roll to succeed (like Overt Order), then the Scion\u2019s player must simply score a number of successes equal to the original commander\u2019s (Manipulation + Command + Legend). In order to countermand a specific Epic Charisma or Epic Manipulation Knack, the Scion using Deprogramming must also know the Knack being used. That is, using Deprogramming to stop Overt Order requires that the Scion performing the countermand must also know Overt Order.

The character can easily manage short sentences and brief conversations. Extended speech, such as giving an academic lecture while underwater, is either too difficult or at least would drastically reduce the time the Scion can hold her breath (at the discretion of the Storyteller).

Doing so costs one Willpower, and the command must be one the Scion can give and the victim can perform in a single action. \u201cFreeze!\u201d is acceptable, as is, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d or, \u201cShoot him!\u201d Ordering someone to go home and shoot his wife won\u2019t work because doing so would take longer than a single action. A victim of this Knack can interpret the command loosely to make it not directly suicidal, but not if all he\u2019s trying to do is keep out of trouble. For example, if a victim draws a gun and the Scion commands him to shoot himself, the victim can shoot himself in the hand or the foot rather than blowing his own brains out.

The dealer might reasonably believe that the ex-con could kill him, but he still can\u2019t weasel out of the command.

Even if her Epic Stamina would obviate the penalty in whole or in part, she still gains the full bonus.

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 10 Legend \nTo a great sage of Taiyi, the difference between ghosts and Gods is more one of degree than of kind. At will, the character can transform a ghost into a lesser immortal with a maximum Legend of 4. This can be a demon, an Earth God, the Chinese analogues to nymphs or alfar \u2014 whatever the Scion wants. To perform this feat, the Scion walks in a circle around the ghost she intends to transform, placing her feet so her steps form stylized images of various groups of stars, a practice called \u201cpacing the constellations.\u201d The transformed ghost may feel some gratitude for his promotion to lesser immortal, and the exercise of Legend has the normal chance of Fatebinding, but the Boon does not intrinsically grant the Scion any control over the lesser immortal he just made."

The line can be as long as the Scion wishes to make it, so long as she traces the entire line in one pass. At the end, she names a creature. This can be as specific or as general as she wishes: \u201ctitanspawn,\u201d \u201cmortals,\u201d \u201cany animal smaller than a rat\u201d and \u201cKane Taoka\u201d are all valid examples. If a creature of that sort crosses the line, the Scion immediately becomes aware of it. There\u2019s no limit to the number of Warning Lines that a Scion can have drawn at once, and she can intuitively tell the difference between any of them. (That is, if she has three different Warning Lines active, she knows which one was tripped at any given time). A Warning Line remains effective for a number of days equal to the player\u2019s activation roll."

The Scion concentrates, touches another character who is using a Boon or spell, and spends a point of Legend. This enhances the target character\u2019s use of the Boon or spell as if his Legend were one higher than its actual value. For instance, a dice pool that included the character\u2019s Legend would gain one die, or the recipient\u2019s Legend would be treated as one higher than its real value (for purposes of Boons whose effectiveness depends on the attacker\u2019s Legend being equal or higher than his target\u2019s)."

This penalty applies to any character with a lesser or equal Legend rating who attempts to attack the Scion.
