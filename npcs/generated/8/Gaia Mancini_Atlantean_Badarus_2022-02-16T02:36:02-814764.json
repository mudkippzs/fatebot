Extended speech, such as giving an academic lecture while underwater, is either too difficult or at least would drastically reduce the time the Scion can hold her breath (at the discretion of the Storyteller).

            "Dice Pool: Stamina + Animal Ken \nCost: 1 Willpower + 1 Legend \nSome shamans believe that consuming a creature grants a measure of its strength. Scions who engage in this practice learn to absorb the capabilities of an animal by devouring such a creature and drawing forth its essence from the digested flesh. The Scion must eat a piece of meat from the appropriate animal (a potentially risky act, considering that the animal is probably considered sacred to his patron God). Then, the player expends the Willpower and Legend and rolls (Stamina + Animal Ken). The successes scored indicate the number of points of Abilities that the Scion may borrow from the animal. A Scion can only borrow Abilities up to the level possessed by the animal, although these dots can add on to his existing skill dots to a maximum total of five. Skills gained with Faunaphagia remain for the rest of the scene."

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: (1 Willpower + 1 lethal health level) per act of creation; 1 Legend per set of units \nBy spending one Willpower point and inflicting one lethal health level of damage on himself, the Scion can create mundane animals of his chosen type from his very blood. Such animals are as loyal to him as those granted by the Creatures Birthright, and he can automatically command them mentally. They follow any command the Scion gives them to the best of their ability, and they last for one scene before dissolving into nothingness once again. To grant the creatures solidity, the Scion must pay a number of Legend points relative to the creature\u2019s size. Doing so allows him to create a number of units of the creature per Legend point spent, as follows:"

            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Craft \nCost: 1 Legend \nFor a number of actions equal to the successes on the activation roll, the Scion can exert limited physical control of any water that is touching her. She can remotely manipulate a hand-held object she can see in the water with her full dice pool, although she can take no other physical actions at the same time. She can stiffen the water beneath her feet in order to walk on its surface. She can even have the water push her along from all sides, allowing her to take a full Move action while swimming, rather than half. Alternatively, moving through the water thus could increase her Dodge DV by an amount equal to her Legend as long as she does nothing but dodge incoming attacks."
