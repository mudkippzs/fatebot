A beautiful Scion can use her Epic Appearance to make a character feel good about himself, granting him an extra Willpower point (which may exceed the character\u2019s maximum) and an extra die on any Art, Athletics, Command, Craft or Integrity dice pools. A hideous Scion in\ufb02icts quite the opposite effect. The fear she instills robs her victim of a Willpower point that he cannot regain until the effect wears off. The Scion also unsettles him so deeply that he loses one die from all Academics, Awareness, Control, Politics or Presence dice pools. Using this Knack costs the Scion a single point of Legend, and its effects last for 24 hours. The Scion can use the Knack on only one person at a time, and the target must be able to see her in person.",

This Knack works on a similar principle, but rather than affecting what people believe, it affects how they act. The character goes out in public and performs some innocuous action in a unique way\u2014 high-fiving himself when he\u2019s happy, for instance\u2014utters a personal catch phrase\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m stressing\u201d\u2014or adopts some distinctive mode of dress\u2014such as wearing his blue Nikes untied and on the wrong feet. If he chooses to activate this Knack when doing so, his player spends two points of Legend and makes a (Manipulation + Presence) roll. If people see him doing this unique and interesting thing while using this Knack, the behavior catches on as the latest fad. The extent to which it becomes a widespread mania is as follows:<br/><table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>Successes</td>\n<td>Who\u2019s Doing It?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Everybody in the neighborhood</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Everybody in the city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Everybody in cities throughout the region</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>Everybody in cities through the nation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>Everybody in the nation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>Everybody in that hemisphere</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>45</td>\n<td>Everybody in the World</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50+</td>\n<td>Even the Gods themselves are doing it</td>\n</tr>\n</table>",

Once everybody who\u2019s going to follow the trend is following the trend, it remains fashionable to do so for a number of weeks equal to the character\u2019s (Legend x 2).

This Knack expands the scope of the effect so that a character can hypnotize a whole group of people. The character\u2019s player rolls (Manipulation + Command + Legend) and spends a point of Legend and a point of Willpower. If the roll scores more successes than the average (Willpower + Legend) of the assembled audience, the character successfully implants the post-hypnotic suggestion in as many members of the audience as he has successes on the roll. Mortals cannot resist the effect or the compulsion to perform the implanted action. Characters with a Legend rating resist at the moment of hypnosis or at the moment the action is designated to take place, as with Instant Hypnosis. Hypnotizing a crowd of people does require that the character capture everyone\u2019s attention at the instant of hypnosis.",

The star-struck victim tries to move to a nearby room, balcony, Jacuzzi or other spot as instructed, in hopes that the Scion will soon arrive. The power of the Knack does all of the convincing. The Scion\u2019s player simply spends one Legend point and picks a single recipient, as with the Come Hither Knack. As usual, the intended recipient must be able to see an image of the Scion, must understand that the message is for her and must have a reasonable idea of how to find him. Meet Me Backstage doesn\u2019t interrupt a subject\u2019s self-preservation any more than Come Hither does: While the subject makes all due haste to reach the appointed meeting place, \u201cdue haste\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cdie along the way.\u201d Nevertheless, this Knack is excellent for discreet rendezvous as well as setting up a poor sap for a beat-down party.

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Willpower + 1 Legend \nThe Scion takes a deep breath and exhales a billowing white mist that sinks to the ground and flows outward to cover the surrounding area in a knee-deep blanket. Doing so renders her inactive for five ticks per dot of Legend she has. This area has a radius equal to one yard per dot of Legend the Scion has. (That\u2019s roughly 1,800 square feet at the minimum.) The mist lasts for the rest of the scene, and while it remains, ghosts that enter the affected area cannot leave it or be forced out of it. Worse (for them), they become fully material and cannot dematerialize. They can still use whatever ghostly powers they have at their disposal, as well as their Attributes and Abilities. If a Scion uses a power or performs an action that ought to hurl the ghost bodily out of the misty area, the ghost stops at the perimeter of the area as if it had hit a wall."

If the Scion tries to exert enough pressure to cause damage or restrain the ghost, her hand passes through its body. With Mother\u2019s Touch, however\u2014named by Scions of Izanami\u2014the Scion charges her body with flickering strands of black energy that can contain or disrupt a ghost\u2019s intangible body. This energy is visible only to ghosts and those who can see ghosts, and the Scion can extend its aura to surround any item in her hands. A measure of the energy even travels with any projectile the Scion throws or fires from an item in her possession, though it dissipates when the projectile comes to rest."

            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Occult \nCost: 1 Legend \nThe Scion mystically calls out to a ghost and commands its immediate presence. To do so, the Scion either holds some item the dead person held dear or holds hands with a blood relative of the deceased as she speaks the ghost\u2019s full name aloud. The ghost automatically hears the call, no matter how far away from the Scion it is. It may resist the summons with a (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll. If the Scion\u2019s player\u2019s roll gets more successes than the ghost\u2019s, the ghost disappears from wherever it was and reappears before the Scion.
