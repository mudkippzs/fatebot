                "Prerequisite Knack: Serpent\u2019s Gaze (Scion: Hero, p. 133) As with the prerequisite Knack, Compelling Performance draws a victim\u2019s attention to the Scion and renders him unable to look away. The victim remains Inactive for combat purposes, staring helplessly at the hideous monster or unearthly beauty before him. Unlike Serpent\u2019s Gaze, though, the Scion need not consciously maintain eye contact with her victim for the effect to endure. Once the victim has been trans\ufb01xed by the Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance, he remains thus until either the end of the scene or until the Scion leaves his line of sight. The victim will follow the Scion with his eyes, even turn in place if she wanders around the immediate area, but he can\u2019t do anything other than look at her. What\u2019s more, the Scion can capture a number of victims with her appearance equal to her (Epic Appearance + Legend) total. Her player only spends one point of Legend per person up to the maximum, and they all stop what they\u2019re doing to stare at her in rapt fascination. When the effect ends, they remember nothing that happened after the \ufb01rst moment they saw the Scion. Mortals and Scions of lesser or equal Legend are unable to look away on their own, but Scions with a greater Legend are not so vulnerable. After the Scion using the Knack takes one full action, the higher-Legend victim may spend a point of Willpower to negate the effect. In so doing, he remains immune to the effect from the same Scion for the rest of the scene.",

This Knack works very well on mortals, but it\u2019s less effective on Scions, who are usually wise to their charismatic peers\u2019 ways.

By spending a point of Willpower and Legend, the Scion cools the crowd\u2019s urge for instant action and buys himself enough time to try to talk some sense into everyone. Doing so is primarily a matter of role-playing, but if the player is not as good an extemporaneous speech-maker as his character is, he may roll (Charisma + Presence) to simulate his heartfelt call for calm. His words convince three members of the mob per success on the roll. This effect lasts for the scene, after which the mob either disperses or renews its shenanigans with its original vigor. If the character is attempting to halt the depredations of a mob that is being controlled or directed supernaturally, use of this Knack constitutes an opposed roll against the other power\u2019s activation roll. If the power has no activation roll per se, the Scion\u2019s player rolls his (Charisma + Presence) against that of the character who incited the mob supernaturally.

(People this ugly rarely have friends, anyway). To activate Do Not Want, the Scion\u2019s player expends three Legend points, then rolls (Appearance + Presence + Legend). Whenever someone first tries to attack or lay hands on the Scion, the aggressor\u2019s player must roll (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). If the attacker scores more successes than the Scion\u2019s player, his character\u2019s actions proceed as normal. If he scores fewer successes than the Scion, then the difference becomes a bonus to the Scion\u2019s DV against the attacker. This bonus persists for the rest of the scene. For example, if the Scion\u2019s player scores 6 successes on the (Appearance + Presence + Legend) roll and an attacker only manages to eke out 3 successes on his (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll, then the Scion gains a +3 bonus to DV against that attacker for the rest of the scene. This benefit applies against everyone who tries to take action against the Scion for the rest of the scene, though each attacker makes a separate resistance roll. (For the sake of sanity, the Storyteller might wish to roll once and apply a blanket penalty for large groups of extras.) Scions whose Epic Appearance represents divine beauty cannot use this Knack.
