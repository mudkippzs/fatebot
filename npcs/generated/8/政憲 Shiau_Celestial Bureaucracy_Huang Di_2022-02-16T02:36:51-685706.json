After inhaling deeply and expending a point of Legend, the Scion can triple the duration she can hold her breath after calculating extended duration due to Epic Stamina. In addition, she becomes immune to pressure changes that come from diving to extreme depths underwater. This Knack doesn\u2019t affect swimming speeds, visibility or other aspects of moving underwater. As a useful side effect, a Scion using this Knack has such great breath control that she can speak when underwater (or otherwise holding her breath) by releasing only a minimal amount of air. The character can easily manage short sentences and brief conversations. Extended speech, such as giving an academic lecture while underwater, is either too difficult or at least would drastically reduce the time the Scion can hold her breath (at the discretion of the Storyteller). This Knack also makes combat underwater much easier, since being struck or injured cannot cause the Scion to lose her breath unless someone makes a deliberate effort to squeeze the air from her lungs.",

Doing so costs one Willpower, and the command must be one the Scion can give and the victim can perform in a single action. \u201cFreeze!\u201d is acceptable, as is, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d or, \u201cShoot him!\u201d Ordering someone to go home and shoot his wife won\u2019t work because doing so would take longer than a single action. A victim of this Knack can interpret the command loosely to make it not directly suicidal, but not if all he\u2019s trying to do is keep out of trouble. For example, if a victim draws a gun and the Scion commands him to shoot himself, the victim can shoot himself in the hand or the foot rather than blowing his own brains out. Same thing goes if a Scion uses this Knack at a seedy pool hall to command a smarmy drug dealer to pick a \ufb01ght with a burly ex-con at the next table. The dealer might reasonably believe that the ex-con could kill him, but he still can\u2019t weasel out of the command. He doesn\u2019t have to walk up and take a swing at the guy, but he still has to do something, such as singing out a racial slur or throwing a beer bottle at the guy\u2019s girlfriend.

When she gets a sensation that her branded charge is in danger (as determined by the Storyteller), she may spend three Legend points to disappear from her current location and instantly reappear in view of the brand she laid down. It helps to concentrate long enough for the player to make the (Perception + Empathy) roll to get an idea of what the danger is before she disappears, but it\u2019s not necessary. Yet, while the character can use Vigil Brand to check up on a charge at any time, the Scion can use Come Running only when the charge in question is in imminent danger."

This penalty applies to any character with a lesser or equal Legend rating who attempts to attack the Scion.

Anything a person can do by hand, the Qi Hand can do as well. Actions involving the Qi Hand use the same dice pools as they would if the character performed the action himself. For instance, wielding a sword using the Qi Hand would call for a (Dexterity + Melee) roll. The Strength of the Qi Hand equals the character\u2019s Legend, so a physically frail Scion could use her Qi Hand to send burly bikers flying."
