            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend per plant/patch per year \nThe Scion need only touch a large plant (such as a tree or bush) or a one-square-yard patch of smaller plants (from a window box of daisies to a sheet of algae) and spend a point of Legend. That plant or patch can then survive for a whole year (or for its whole life if its natural span is shorter) without food or sunlight or water. The Scion\u2019s ministrations keep the plant healthy through drought, nutrient deficiency, unnatural darkness or other environmental shortfall. The plant\u2019s surroundings must be within its natural tolerances for the plant to survive, though. (This Boon can\u2019t nurture seaweed on the desert floor, for instance.) Also, this Boon doesn\u2019t protect against or cure any blight or damage from herbivorous noshing."

Such animals are as loyal to him as those granted by the Creatures Birthright, and he can automatically command them mentally. They follow any command the Scion gives them to the best of their ability, and they last for one scene before dissolving into nothingness once again. To grant the creatures solidity, the Scion must pay a number of Legend points relative to the creature\u2019s size. Doing so allows him to create a number of units of the creature per Legend point spent, as follows:"

Her command of it is now such, however, that she can exert her full Strength and even Epic Strength through the water on some object, just as if she were affecting that object with her physical body. She can also stiffen water\u2019s surface such that not only she, but other people who fit onto the affected area can all walk on it.

The character\u2019s Physical Attributes are normal for a mundane specimen of the animal he\u2019s become, but his Mental Attributes remain his own. He also retains access to his Epic Mental Attributes and Knacks, though his other Epic Attributes are off limits until he regains his human form. He can communicate with other animals of his type.
