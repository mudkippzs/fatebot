On one hand, he can heal as many health levels of bashing damage as his player gets successes on a (Stamina + Medicine) roll. Doing so costs one Legend. Alternatively, he can downgrade a number of health levels equal to successes on the roll from lethal to bashing damage. Doing so costs one Willpower."
