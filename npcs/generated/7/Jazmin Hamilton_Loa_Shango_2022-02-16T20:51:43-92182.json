If he can see clouds in the sky from his current vantage, he can shape and sculpt them with the motions of his hands. Many such artists prefer to sculpt clouds while looking through a window, as the glass pane gives them something solid to bear down on and trace out their sky designs. The Scion can\u2019t add or erase clouds, but he can stretch thick clouds thin or compress many wispy clouds into one large, billowy mass."

These perceptions include input from all five senses, though not the character\u2019s subjective reactions to that input. To use this Boon, the Scion must have a picture of her victim, some genetic token of the victim\u2019s (such as a lock of hair or several drops of blood) or something the victim created (from a printed-out email to an ice sculpture). By meditating on the item and relaxing her own perceptions\u2014as well as spending a point of Legend after a successful (Perception + Empathy) roll on the part of her player\u2014the Scion experiences the victim\u2019s perceptions clearly and distinctly. The victim is unaware of the Scion\u2019s attention, but the Scion remains semi-aware of her own surroundings."

Her player then rolls (Wits + Command) and spends a Willpower point. If the roll succeeds, the Scion ties together the physical health of as many people who are present as possible. That is, if one person in the group suffers any damage, everyone included in the effect suffers the same pain and damage. For the base cost, she can tie the health of two people together. She can include one extra person beyond that for every extra Legend point she spends at the same time. The effect lasts for a maximum number of days equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend."

With Mind-Riding, however, the Scion can listen in on the thoughts of the person whose senses she\u2019s riding. These thoughts whisper in the rider\u2019s mind, and the mental images they conjure play behind the rider\u2019s eyes. Yet, while the rider has access to her victim\u2019s conscious thoughts, she garners only what context those thoughts provide. She can\u2019t snoop around in the victim\u2019s memory to make sense of an enigmatic reaction. While using Rada\u2019s Eyes, the Scion need only spend an additional point of Legend in order to listen in on the host\u2019s thoughts."

If the Scion succeeds in her possession attempt, she can \u201cride\u201d around inside her victim\u2019s body for one scene (or less if she chooses to end the effect early).
