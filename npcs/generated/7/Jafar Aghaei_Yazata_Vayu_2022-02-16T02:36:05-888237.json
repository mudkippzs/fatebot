                "Prerequisite Knack: Overt Order (Scion: Hero, p. 131) With a moment of eye contact and the expenditure of a Willpower point, the Scion instantly plunges a mortal into a hypnotic trance. Attempting to hypnotize a fellow Scion of lesser or equal (Willpower + Legend) requires not only a Willpower expenditure but a (Manipulation + Command + Legend) roll contested against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). Scions cannot instantly hypnotize fellow Scions of higher (Willpower + Legend). Should he successfully hypnotize a victim, the Scion can implant one hidden command that the victim must obey at the time of the Scion\u2019s choosing. The command must be something that the victim can accomplish in one scene, and the trigger condition that compels him to attempt it must occur within a number of months equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. The Scion can give as speci\ufb01c an order as he pleases, and a mortal cannot interpret it in any way other than the spirit in which it was intended. A fellow Scion can interpret it loosely to his own advantage, as per Overt Order, but doing so costs him a point of Willpower. The victim remains unaware of the ticking time bomb in his subconscious, but he does have a chance to resist it when the trigger condition occurs. At the moment when he has been commanded to perform the action in question, the victim\u2019s player may make a (Wits + Integrity) roll. (This roll cannot be modi\ufb01ed by a Scion\u2019s Epic Wits or an Integrity Arete.) If the roll garners more successes than the hypnotist Scion has dots of Legend, the compulsion is broken. If the last-minute resistance roll fails, the victim must attempt to do as he was commanded. Whether he succeeds or fails, the compulsion ends after he makes the attempt, and he has no memory of what could possibly have convinced him to do as he did.",

            "Dice Pool: Integrity + Legend \nCost: 10 Legend \nWhen the Scion uses this Boon, one of her chosen Amesha Spentas manifests to assist her. The aura of the Amesha Spenta flows off her body to coalesce as an abstract humanoid figure formed of the physical principle of the Amesha Spenta (i.e., fire for Asha Vahishta, water for Haurvetat, etc.) \nThe Amesha Spenta has all the Scion\u2019s dice pools and can use all the Boons that the Scion knows from the relevant purview. It acts by the Scion\u2019s will, but takes its own actions. As an abstract concept given form, though, the mystic helper cannot do anything but move and use Boons. It also uses the Scion\u2019s Legend to power those Boons. No mundane force can harm an Amesha Spenta, but attacks backed by Epic Attributes, Arete, or other supernatural means deal damage as normal. The Amesha Spenta has soak equal to the Scion\u2019s natural soak (including Epic Stamina) and it has five \u20130 Health levels. \nThis Boon may be used once per scene. The Amesha Spenta lasts for one minute per success on the activation roll. \nThe Scion may also select a fifth Amesha Spenta to associate with Asha, as per the previous Boon."

She may create her own, seventh Amesha Spenta, for whatever All-Purpose Purview she wants: Chaos, Health, War, whatever. Yazata traditionally choose Sun, to improve their connection to Divine Light, or Stars, the purview of cosmic order \u2014 but they can choose anything. However, a character can only do this once: She cannot go on to create further Amesha Spentas. A Yazata\u2019s personal Amesha Spenta has the same effects as the basic six, with the same cost to manifest. What\u2019s more, the Yazata may now spend 15 Legend and 1 Willpower to evoke all seven of her Amesha Spentas as helpers"

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend \nA Scion with Death Senses (Death 1) can see, hear and touch ghosts that won\u2019t or can\u2019t materialize, but the sense of touch that that Boon grants is illusory at best. If the Scion tries to exert enough pressure to cause damage or restrain the ghost, her hand passes through its body. With Mother\u2019s Touch, however\u2014named by Scions of Izanami\u2014the Scion charges her body with flickering strands of black energy that can contain or disrupt a ghost\u2019s intangible body. This energy is visible only to ghosts and those who can see ghosts, and the Scion can extend its aura to surround any item in her hands. A measure of the energy even travels with any projectile the Scion throws or fires from an item in her possession, though it dissipates when the projectile comes to rest."

            "Dice Pool: Wits + Empathy \nCost: 1 Willpower \nThis Boon turns a person\u2019s rational thoughts into seething, chaotic noise. On a successful activation roll, the victim freezes in place, suddenly unable to think, speak or act. He\u2019s unaware of what goes on around him, and he has no memory of the moments before or after the use of this Boon. The effect lasts for a number of actions equal to the successes on the activation roll, and it erases the victim\u2019s memory for an equal amount of time before the roll. If the victim has more dots of Legend than the user, the power doesn\u2019t work.

Doing so requires one Legend point per action, and the Scion\u2019s player rolls (Wits + Brawl) to direct the winds. This roll functions just as the normal roll for a clinch attack, contested against the defender\u2019s efforts as normal. If his attack succeeds, the Scion may do with his victim as any successful grappler can do with a subdued victim, from pinning him to crushing him to throwing him. The attacker cannot apply any bonus dice or Knacks from his Epic Strength in these grappling maneuvers."
