Her body naturally and instinctively adjusts to account for all changes in pressure. Under Pressure can\u2019t protect a Scion against bruising and crushing damage: If she\u2019s stuck in the aforementioned Titanic gullet, she\u2019ll have to use other abilities to deal with the digestive action and the acid.

                "Prerequisite Knack: Body Armor (Scion: Demigod, pp. 57-58) By concentrating all of his phenomenal stamina on a single point of his body, the Scion can make a tiny area nigh-invulnerable. For a second, the Scion\u2019s ichor seeps into that small point no larger than a fingernail, and that part of the Scion\u2019s body becomes tremendously difficult to damage. The area affected gains a Hardness rating (see Scion: Hero, p. 201) equal to the Scion\u2019s Epic Stamina. Any attack with fewer damage dice than the Hardness rating simply bounces off with no effect, while an attack with more damage dice loses a number of dice equal to the Hardness rating before the Scion attempts to soak it (as a special extension of Hardness, which normally only applies to inanimate objects). The real trick lies in positioning this tiny, invulnerable spot to absorb an attack. Normally, a Scion uses his Parry DV to defect attacks in this fashion. Since the Scion has the Body Armor Knack as a prerequisite, he can already Parry melee attacks. Instead, Invulnerable Nail provides the Scion with a defense against an attack that he can see coming but can\u2019t parry, such as when he\u2019s held in place by a titanspawn\u2019s tentacle and needs to make his forehead momentarily impenetrable to the oncoming needle- tipped appendage that will try to suck out his brain. In such a case, the Scion keeps his full unarmed Parry DV because he can try to defect the attack at the last moment by anticipating where it will strike and fortifying that part of his body. Similarly, a clever Scion might feign suicide by attacking himself with a mundane weapon and defecting it at the last minute through the use of this Knack. Activating this Knack costs two points of Legend. It is a reflexive action done in response to an attack.",
