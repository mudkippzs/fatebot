Doing the former involves talking the victim through some genuine memory and \u201ccorrecting\u201d details as they come out. Creating a false memory from whole cloth is simply a matter of the character describing the \u201cremembered\u201d events to the victim and telling her when and where those events occurred. False or altered memories replace the originals in the victim\u2019s mind, erasing what was in their place originally. The cost, dice pool, restrictions and resistance mechanics of this Knack are the same as for Instant Hypnosis. If the victim is mortal (or another type of extra), she won\u2019t ever accept that her new memories are false. She might think she was on drugs at the time or was hallucinating with fever, but she clings to the belief that the memory is genuine. Characters with a Legend rating will assume as mortals do unless they are confronted with evidence to suggest the memories are false. Even then, however, they still cannot get their original memories back.",

When she awakens, she can access her memories of all that happened around her, just as if she had been lying there feigning slumber.

This Knack, however, removes that limitation so that a character can sense things happening at a significant remove.
