For the rest of the scene, the Scion controls the animal\u2019s body just as a character with Horse (Cheval \u2022\u2022\u2022) can control a human\u2019s body.

With this Boon, she can take liquid water, steam, ice or fog and change any one into any of the other three. The amount of water she can affect is the same as per Water Control, and the water remains in its new state for a number of actions equal to the successes rolled to activate the Boon. Water under this effect is also subject to the Scion\u2019s Water Control as long as the Scion maintains contact with some portion of it."

The task cannot seem suicidal or impossible to the animal, but the animal cannot balk at an order that doesn\u2019t immediately seem so. \u201cHey rabbit, go rip that lion\u2019s throat open,\u201d would seem impossible to the rabbit so commanded. \u201cRun to that grass across this street,\u201d would be a fine order for that same rabbit, though, even if cars were zipping by. The order can describe a single immediate action (\u201cBite that guy!\u201d) or one with a single condition (\u201cCome find me when a blue car stops here.\u201d). If he lacks the previous Boon, the Scion can deliver his command only through simplistic nonverbal signals."

This cloud swirls around him and accumulates on his body like a suit of plate armor plus helmet. Any earthen substance will suffice, from gravel to mud to sand. The armor the coating of particles creates has a bashing and lethal Hardness and soak equal to half the Scion\u2019s Legend (rounded up), as well as a mobility penalty equal to that of riot gear. It lasts for the rest of the scene, at the end of which it shatters into a million pieces and falls at the Scion\u2019s feet.

She can breathe water as easily as air, and she is neither scalded by boiling water nor subject to debilitating frostbite from ice. Having boiling water poured on one\u2019s flesh still hurts, mind you, and being bound in ice or cast adrift in frigid water can still numb and paralyze a Scion.

Scions who engage in this practice learn to absorb the capabilities of an animal by devouring such a creature and drawing forth its essence from the digested flesh. The Scion must eat a piece of meat from the appropriate animal (a potentially risky act, considering that the animal is probably considered sacred to his patron God). Then, the player expends the Willpower and Legend and rolls (Stamina + Animal Ken). The successes scored indicate the number of points of Abilities that the Scion may borrow from the animal. A Scion can only borrow Abilities up to the level possessed by the animal, although these dots can add on to his existing skill dots to a maximum total of five. Skills gained with Faunaphagia remain for the rest of the scene."

Potability allows the Scion to touch one source of water no larger than a bathtub and cause any liquid in it to become safe to drink. While various contaminants may remain, including living beings, the water will not be poisonous or disease-laden. It might be brown, it might have algae floating on top, and it might taste like dirt mixed with baking soda, but it\u2019ll quench thirst and function for irrigation, if necessary."

For every two Legend points spent, she can create a quantity of gallons equal to the successes on the activation roll. This water can be either salt or fresh water, though one activation roll can create only one or the other. The water comes from the Scion\u2019s hands at room temperature, about as fast as it comes out of a normal faucet on full blast\u2014at a rate of roughly two gallons per minute."

He also retains access to his Epic Mental Attributes and Knacks, though his other Epic Attributes are off limits until he regains his human form. He can communicate with other animals of his type.

If he\u2019s looking for something specific in the earth\u2014such as gold, oil or a human body\u2014this Boon reveals its distance from him and depth from the epicenter at the expense of the other information.
