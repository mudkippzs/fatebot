While the Scion doesn\u2019t become completely suffused with plant-like characteristics, she does develop a noticeable greenish tint to her skin and hair. Her flesh becomes woody and slightly tough, which grants her one extra level of soak against lethal and bashing damage. She also gains the ability to draw sustenance by photosynthesis. So long as she garners at least four hours of sunlight in a day, she obviates her need for food completely. (While her body might still require a few trace elements, they are so negligible as to be ignored). Lastly, her blood becomes thick and sticky, completely mitigating any bleeding that might happen as a result of wounds; her injuries cover over in a translucent amber almost immediately. Greenskin lasts for a number of scenes equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend, or until the Scion chooses to cancel the effect."

Resisting the effect requires a (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll that nets more successes than the Scion\u2019s player rolled. Those who cannot resist the effect suffer a distraction penalty to all rolls equal to the number of Legend points the Scion\u2019s player spent to activate the effect (up to a maximum equal to that Scion\u2019s Legend). This distraction lasts for 24 hours."
