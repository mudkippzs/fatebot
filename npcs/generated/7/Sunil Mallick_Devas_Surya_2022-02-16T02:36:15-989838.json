                "Prerequisite Knack: Takes One to Know One (Scion: Hero, p. 132); possibly others (see text) Usually, mortals and even other Scions who\u2019ve been influenced by Epic Charisma or Epic Manipulation go about their business blissfully unaware that they\u2019ve been duped. With a few well-chosen words to reinforce the subject\u2019s awareness of the situation, though, a Scion with this Knack can help people snap out of the unnatural influence of others. The player spends Legend equal to the cost of the power being countered plus one (plus an additional three Legend for every point of Willpower spent on the power being countered), then rolls (Manipulation + Presence + Legend). If the player rolls more successes than the original command, the subject immediately snaps out of it and realizes that he didn\u2019t want to do whatever it is that he was compelled to do. If the original power didn\u2019t require a roll to succeed (like Overt Order), then the Scion\u2019s player must simply score a number of successes equal to the original commander\u2019s (Manipulation + Command + Legend). In order to countermand a specific Epic Charisma or Epic Manipulation Knack, the Scion using Deprogramming must also know the Knack being used. That is, using Deprogramming to stop Overt Order requires that the Scion performing the countermand must also know Overt Order. Using this Knack in combat can be tricky: Typically, the Scion will want to wait (perhaps taking a Guard action) and then interrupt when needed.",

The prerequisite Knack enables him to in\ufb02ict lethal damage during a clinch that he controls, and this Knack builds on that to awful effect. If the Scion spends a point of Legend during a clinch, he can make a single attack in\ufb02ict aggravated damage instead of lethal. What\u2019s more, his normal unarmed combat attacks now in\ufb02ict lethal damage instead of bashing damage. Keep in mind that that lethal damage is now the standard damage he in\ufb02icts unarmed, regardless of whether he spends the point of Legend to make a single clinch\u2019s damage aggravated.

The name of this Knack, however, speaks for itself. Any action the character can perform as a feat of strength, he can perform as if it\u2019s no effort at all. He can lift the heaviest weights with one hand while using his other hand to cover a yawn. He can throw a spear into orbit with a flick of his finger. He can scoop the beached whale up in one hand and send it skipping like a stone out into the deep water where it can move freely (if dizzily) once again.

At the very least, you want to know if the minion was killed in the attempt. With Return to Sender, the Scion prompts someone to return immediately to her after performing a task delegated with Epic Manipulation. The player spends an additional point of Legend to activate this power when using any other Epic Manipulation Knack to force a subject to take an action.

                "Prerequisite Knack: Mighty Heave (Scion: Demigod, p. 55) A character with Epic Strength can throw normal-sized objects (such as baseballs or darts) ridiculously far. He can also lift incredibly heavy objects. He can even throw those heavy objects, but he can\u2019t throw them very far. A God with the utmost in Strength and Athletics and 10 dots of Epic Strength can throw something he can lift with Epic Strength 9 only about 400 yards away. If the object is big enough \u2014 if it\u2019s a nuclear submarine, for instance, with a bay full of missiles that are about to explode \u2014 400 yards isn\u2019t very far at all. With this Knack, however, a character can hurl an object that he can lift and throw as a feat of strength as far as he can throw a dart without penalties deriving from Range. The sort of epic feats this Knack allow work best as narrative effects in combat, as the logistics of hurling such projectiles as fire stations, the Washington Monument or J\u00f6rmungandr at one\u2019s enemies can get somewhat more math-intensive than is strictly ideal. Hurl to the Moon does not affect the distance a character can throw a normal-sized object, but it does intensify the damage such an object can cause. Such damage is considered aggravated, and the projectile takes on the Piercing quality if it does not already have it. Each attack thus enhanced costs the God two points of Legend, however.",
