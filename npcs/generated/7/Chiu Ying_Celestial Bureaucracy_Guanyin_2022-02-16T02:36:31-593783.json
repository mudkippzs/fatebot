While the character does so, he cannot see, hear or smell anything that\u2019s happening around his body.

All matter is just a particularly dense form of Qi, and the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams govern all their transformations. A scholar of the Great Principle of Change can nudge this potential for change into new paths, and so transform matter into new forms and substances. To do this, she need merely touch the object and trace out the trigrams that represent the sort of change she desires. For a small change, she can trace the trigrams with her finger. Large objects (anything larger than person-sized) requires drawing trigrams on the object using ink, chalk or some other means."

An affected male definitely impregnates the next female he has sex with if she is even theoretically capable of having children; an affected female definitely becomes pregnant from the next male with whom she has sex. Even infertile participants become temporarily fertile, and birth control devices fail. A Scion may use this Boon automatically on himself or any unresisting mortal animal or human. Consciously unwilling subjects may resist with a (Stamina + Fortitude) roll against the Scion\u2019s (Stamina + Medicine). Titanspawn, Scions other than the user, and other supernatural beings are always considered unwilling even if they would welcome the Boon\u2019s effect, for their supernatural aspect inherently resists the power.
