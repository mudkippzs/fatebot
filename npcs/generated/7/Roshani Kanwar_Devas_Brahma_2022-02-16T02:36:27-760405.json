He can reason around a berserker\u2019s shock and awe or calculate a dodging foe\u2019s final location to slip past that foe\u2019s defenses. He can find just the right angle to slip from an opponent\u2019s grasp, and he can see through feints and other ploys with ease. The Scion activates this Knack by selecting an opponent and spending one point of Legend. For the rest of the scene, he counteracts the automatic successes, bonus dice and similar benefits conferred by other Knacks and Boons. The total number of such bonuses counteracted cannot exceed the Scion\u2019s automatic success from Epic Intelligence. This Knack can negate bonuses from Knacks and Boons, as well as automatic successes and bonuses from Epic Attributes themselves. It does not affect stunt bonuses or extra dice from invoking Virtues. If an opponent receives more bonuses than a Scion can counteract, the user of this Knack picks what he will negate. This Knack might seem an odd one to include in a book about the Norse and their Gods. In truth, despite their famed fury and aggression, Norse warriors valued a cunning fighter at least as much as a frenzied powerhouse.",

She can recognize their voices despite electronic distortion or overpowering background noise. She knows their scents and their body language and even the exact feel of the way they shake hands. She can also recognize an imposter when someone tries to mimic the voice or appearance of someone to whom she is Fatebound. Recognizing others is not quite as easy. If, when a Scion encounters a character to whom she is not Fatebound, she makes a concerted effort to try to remember that character\u2019s looks and mannerisms, the player may spend a point of Willpower to lock that image in the Scion\u2019s mind. After that, she retains the ability to recognize him despite all obfuscation for the rest of the story as if they two were Fatebound. Thereafter, the Scion loses any supernatural ability she had to recognize that character. (She doesn\u2019t forget what the character looks like, mind you. It\u2019s just that the Knack no longer applies to that person.) The timing of when the Scion recognizes a person is entirely up to the Storyteller as dictated by the needs of the story. If the private investigator who\u2019s been dogging the Scion\u2019s heels tries to slink up to the character in disguise at a crowded charity fund-raiser, the Scion might see the gumshoe coming a mile away (even despite the fake beard, the fat suit, the spray-on tan and the sex change). If a Scion of Loki who\u2019s a rival to a player\u2019s Scion of Anubis arrives in disguise to deliver a cryptic warning, the Scion of Anubis might not recognize her old foe until the trickster disappears with a wink behind the elevator\u2019s closing doors. Finally, as a side effect of this Knack, a Scion can always recognize when someone who is not in disguise is biologically related to a person she knows well (regardless of whether that person is Fatebound to her). She cannot intuitively grasp what that relationship is, but she knows it\u2019s there\u2014even if the person in question doesn\u2019t.",

That plant or patch can then survive for a whole year (or for its whole life if its natural span is shorter) without food or sunlight or water. The Scion\u2019s ministrations keep the plant healthy through drought, nutrient deficiency, unnatural darkness or other environmental shortfall. The plant\u2019s surroundings must be within its natural tolerances for the plant to survive, though. (This Boon can\u2019t nurture seaweed on the desert floor, for instance.) Also, this Boon doesn\u2019t protect against or cure any blight or damage from herbivorous noshing."

            "Rust/Shine",
            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 2 Legend \nWith a pass of the hand, the Scion causes a coating of rust or oxidization to form on a metallic object or conversely removes such a coating, restoring an item to its untarnished form. A rusted metal object loses durability and functionality. Its Hardness decreases to half normal, and if the object is a precision item (like a gun), it has a 50% chance to malfunction any time it\u2019s used. Restoring a rusted item to its original state wipes away all traces of age and even reverses the effects, so that a wholly rusted-out car body (for instance) would be as good as new. The rusted parts don\u2019t just disappear, they reverse the process and become solid metal again. Invoking this power on an item requires the Scion to physically touch or manipulate the object, and it has no effect on metals that don\u2019t rust (such as gold) or upon Relics."

            "Greenskin",
            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 2 Legend \nWith a moment\u2019s thought, the Scion reflects upon the characteristics of the green, growing world. She then internalizes those characteristics, granting herself some of the features of a plant. While the Scion doesn\u2019t become completely suffused with plant-like characteristics, she does develop a noticeable greenish tint to her skin and hair. Her flesh becomes woody and slightly tough, which grants her one extra level of soak against lethal and bashing damage. She also gains the ability to draw sustenance by photosynthesis. So long as she garners at least four hours of sunlight in a day, she obviates her need for food completely. (While her body might still require a few trace elements, they are so negligible as to be ignored). Lastly, her blood becomes thick and sticky, completely mitigating any bleeding that might happen as a result of wounds; her injuries cover over in a translucent amber almost immediately. Greenskin lasts for a number of scenes equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend, or until the Scion chooses to cancel the effect."

            "Natural Camouflage",
            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Stealth \nCost: 1 Legend \nWhen the Scion hides in her verdant element, it\u2019s almost impossible to find her. Her skin sprouts grass, bark, underbrush, flowers, mushrooms or what have you that allow her to blend in seamlessly with her natural surroundings. As long as she doesn\u2019t move or otherwise draw attention to herself, mundane attempts to find or track her fail automatically. A mortal hunter with a trusty hound could walk right over the Scion\u2019s disguised back and never know she was there. Hunters of supernatural prowess fare only a little better. Those with the Epic Perception Knack Predatory Focus or a Survival Arete can attempt to track the hidden Scion\u2019s movements, their players rolling (Perception + Survival) against the hiding Scion\u2019s activation roll. Even if they get more successes than the Scion\u2019s player did, though, the hunters find only the general area in which the Scion is hiding. (They come to an area within a number of yards equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend but lose track of her unless she moves again.) Only hunters with the Supernal Hunter Knack are actually skilled enough to find a Scion who\u2019s using this Boon to hide (and only if their rolls garner more successes than the Scion\u2019s)."

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend per missile \nAt high noon or darkest midnight, the Scion can fire projectiles of solid sunlight at her enemies. As long as she has a weapon such as a bow, a firearm, a sling or even an atlatl, her player can spend a point of Legend to create glowing ammunition for it out of pure sunlight. Using this Boon adds a number of levels of damage equal to the character\u2019s Legend to the damage roll\u2019s results before soak. Attacks made using this Boon always inflict lethal damage\u2014 unless the target has a special susceptibility to sunlight\u2014and always have the Piercing quality."

The Scion can move only through a volume of earth large enough to accommodate his entire body. Also, unless the Scion has Safely Interred (Earth \u2022), he can remain within the earth for only as long as he can hold his breath. If he stays under longer, he begins to drown. While he\u2019s under, the Scion instinctively knows his way to the nearest air."
