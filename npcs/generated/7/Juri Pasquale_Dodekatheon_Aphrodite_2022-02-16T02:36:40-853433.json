(People this ugly rarely have friends, anyway). To activate Do Not Want, the Scion\u2019s player expends three Legend points, then rolls (Appearance + Presence + Legend). Whenever someone first tries to attack or lay hands on the Scion, the aggressor\u2019s player must roll (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). If the attacker scores more successes than the Scion\u2019s player, his character\u2019s actions proceed as normal. If he scores fewer successes than the Scion, then the difference becomes a bonus to the Scion\u2019s DV against the attacker. This bonus persists for the rest of the scene. For example, if the Scion\u2019s player scores 6 successes on the (Appearance + Presence + Legend) roll and an attacker only manages to eke out 3 successes on his (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll, then the Scion gains a +3 bonus to DV against that attacker for the rest of the scene. This benefit applies against everyone who tries to take action against the Scion for the rest of the scene, though each attacker makes a separate resistance roll. (For the sake of sanity, the Storyteller might wish to roll once and apply a blanket penalty for large groups of extras.) Scions whose Epic Appearance represents divine beauty cannot use this Knack. Also, it doesn\u2019t work on ugly Scions with more dots of Epic Appearance than the one using the Knack.",

                "Prerequisite Knack: Blurt It Out (Scion: Hero, p. 131) This Knack is similar to the Epic Charisma Knack called Borrowed Credibility (pp. 67-68) in that it allows a character to exert her Epic Attribute remotely through an agent or emissary. Doing so costs three Legend points and the player rolls her character\u2019s Manipulation-based dice pool. She then confers on a single emissary the results of that roll, including any bonus successes from Epic Manipulation, and instructs that emissary to try to convince someone of something important on her behalf. When the emissary goes to the intended person and tries to do as the Scion said, he uses the Scion\u2019s Manipulation roll instead of that of his own social roll. If the character actually wants the emissary to achieve the goal she tells the emissary to achieve, her player can simply roll the appropriate Manipulation-based dice pool and let her result substitute for what would be the emissary\u2019s roll of the same dice pool. Unlike with Borrowed Credibility, though, the character with this Knack can seed an effect in the emissary that is quite different from the one the emissary is instructed to use. In neither case does the emissary\u2019s player make the Manipulation-based roll himself. He simply says the words and lets the results of the conferred roll have their desired effect on the listener. The listener believes, however, that his decision is based solely on the emissary\u2019s efforts and remains unaware of the manipulator\u2019s influence. Character\u2019s with this Knack can use it on any willing character of lesser Legend\u2014though the character need not know or understand a contrary hidden intent. It works on only a single target, to whom the emissary must specifically address his remarks.",

Only solid, incontrovertible proof showing that what the Scion said was undeniably false will convince the mark he\u2019s been fooled. Even then, who ever is showing him the proof will have to convince him that the proof is genuine and not some clever forgery. A Scion with this Knack doesn\u2019t have to lie when she uses it. She can also use it to convince a recalcitrant skeptic of the actual truth.

Others confront victims who are surrounded by family, friends or coworkers, in order to make those victims admit damning information when it will do the most harm.

The Scion cannot simply shout \u201cJ\u2019accuse!\u201d then use Blurt It Out to force a random confession from a guilty person. (The declamatory French comes only after the Scion uses Blurt It Out effectively.) Regardless, a victim still has a slim chance to catch himself before bringing disaster crashing down. The victim\u2019s player rolls (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) against a dif\ufb01culty equal to (the Scion\u2019s Epic Manipulation + 1).
