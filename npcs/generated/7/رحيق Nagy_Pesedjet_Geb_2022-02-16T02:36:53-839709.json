            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Occult \nCost: 5 Legend + 1 Willpower \nNormally, a person\u2019s ba and ka remain separate until that person\u2019s death. When he dies, his ba and ka unite into a luminous hybrid being of pure energy called the akh. A Scion with this Boon, however, can blend his ba and ka at will, awakening his akh and separating it from his physical body while he yet lives. When he does so, a ghostly golden form rises from within him while his body slumps insensate to the ground. The shining form looks like the character minus his clothing or equipment, except that lambent energy dances across his skin and iridescent wings like those of a beetle flicker around his shoulders and behind his back. These wings enable him to fly at his normal Move rate."

When she confronts someone she suspects committed an injustice and accuses that person of having done so, her player rolls (Perception + Empathy). (This roll isn\u2019t modified by supernatural powers or contested by the suspect\u2019s player.) On a success, the Scion can intuitively tell whether the suspect is guilty as charged. A failure yields an indeterminate reading and means that the Scion can\u2019t try to determine the same subject\u2019s guilt for 24 hours. A botch yields a false reading."

Its Hardness decreases to half normal, and if the object is a precision item (like a gun), it has a 50% chance to malfunction any time it\u2019s used. Restoring a rusted item to its original state wipes away all traces of age and even reverses the effects, so that a wholly rusted-out car body (for instance) would be as good as new.
