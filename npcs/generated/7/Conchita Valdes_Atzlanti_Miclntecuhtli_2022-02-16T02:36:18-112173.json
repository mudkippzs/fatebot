Successful resistance breaks the spell for the rest of its duration; a failure means the character cannot try to break away again for another hour.

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1 Legend \nA Scion with Death Senses (Death 1) can see, hear and touch ghosts that won\u2019t or can\u2019t materialize, but the sense of touch that that Boon grants is illusory at best. If the Scion tries to exert enough pressure to cause damage or restrain the ghost, her hand passes through its body. With Mother\u2019s Touch, however\u2014named by Scions of Izanami\u2014the Scion charges her body with flickering strands of black energy that can contain or disrupt a ghost\u2019s intangible body. This energy is visible only to ghosts and those who can see ghosts, and the Scion can extend its aura to surround any item in her hands. A measure of the energy even travels with any projectile the Scion throws or fires from an item in her possession, though it dissipates when the projectile comes to rest."

            "Dice Pool: Perception + Empathy (to check up) \nCost: 1 Legend (to brand) \nThe Scion touches a person, an object or the entrance to a location and lays a mystical brand there that marks that subject as being under her protection. (Doing so costs one Legend.) Thereafter, whenever that subject is in physical danger (as determined by the Storyteller), the Scion receives a reflexive intuition to that effect. Should her player then succeed on a (Perception + Empathy) roll, she gains a clearer understanding of the subject\u2019s condition, location and current situation."

The Scion must touch the being for one action (Speed 6) and spend one Legend point. If the Scion wants to know whether the victim is truly willing to die, her player can roll (Perception + Empathy) while the Scion touches the victim. Animals usually answer in the affirmative and titanspawn usually do the opposite, but human beings and Scions are unpredictable."
