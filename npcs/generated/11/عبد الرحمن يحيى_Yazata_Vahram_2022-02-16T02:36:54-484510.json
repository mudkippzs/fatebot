In addition, she becomes immune to pressure changes that come from diving to extreme depths underwater. This Knack doesn\u2019t affect swimming speeds, visibility or other aspects of moving underwater. As a useful side effect, a Scion using this Knack has such great breath control that she can speak when underwater (or otherwise holding her breath) by releasing only a minimal amount of air. The character can easily manage short sentences and brief conversations. Extended speech, such as giving an academic lecture while underwater, is either too difficult or at least would drastically reduce the time the Scion can hold her breath (at the discretion of the Storyteller). This Knack also makes combat underwater much easier, since being struck or injured cannot cause the Scion to lose her breath unless someone makes a deliberate effort to squeeze the air from her lungs.",

First, the character can stomp or strike the ground with his \ufb01sts or a weapon, which sends a shock wave outward from him along the ground across an area with a radius equal to his Epic Strength in yards. Striking the ground thus to send out the shock wave requires a Strength roll, which receives the bene\ufb01t of his Epic Strength. Potential victims \u2014 friend and foe alike \u2014 compare their Dodge DV to the results of this roll. If their DV overcomes the Scion\u2019s successes, they manage to jump and let the shock wave pass beneath them. If their DV isn\u2019t high enough, they immediately suffer knockdown as well as an amount of bashing damage equal to however many of the Scion\u2019s successes their DV couldn\u2019t cancel out. (If his allies know the Scion is about to use this Knack \u2014 if his using it is part of a coordinated assault, for instance \u2014 they can jump out of the way preemptively without having to rely on their DVs.) This attack in\ufb02icts no damage on the \ufb02oor or the ground the Scion strikes. All the energy is expended into the shock wave. The second form this power takes is more selective and deliberate. As with the \ufb01rst form, the Scion strikes the ground and sends a shock wave along the surface out to a distance equal to his Epic Strength in yards. This time, though, his player makes a standard Dexterity-based attack roll and targets a single opponent. If that opponent\u2019s Dodge DV isn\u2019t high enough to get him out of the way of the attack, the Scion\u2019s player then makes a Strength roll, modi\ufb01ed by his Epic Strength but not modi\ufb01ed by his extra successes on the attack roll. The damage this attack in\ufb02icts is bashing, but it has one other effect that renders the victim almost helpless for a moment afterward. Any successes on the Strength roll that exceed the victim\u2019s soak not only in\ufb02ict damage but also hurl the victim straight up in the air (one yard per unsoaked success). The victim\u2019s rise and fall takes six ticks, during which his DVs are considered to be halved. He can make ranged attacks at a -5 penalty, but he can\u2019t move or jump or do much of anything until he lands again. In fact, if the Scion\u2019s attack sends him high enough in the air, the victim might take damage from crashing back down from so great a height.

The flame has the intensity of a bonfire, and it covers an area with a radius in yards equal to the number of successes on the activation roll. The flames stand as high from a flat surface as the Scion is tall. This fire can burn without fuel for a number of minutes equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. When that time is up, the flames go out if they still don\u2019t have any fuel. People who are within the area the Scion intends to set alight get a single chance to escape the affected area unharmed before the fire starts. To do so, their players must get more successes on a (Dexterity + Athletics) roll than the Scion\u2019s player got on the activation roll, and the character must be able to get out of the area in one action."

When he does so, the fire becomes a three-dimensional mass that he can manipulate in all three dimensions in any way his imagination can conceive. For five Legend points, the God can manipulate 10 cubic yards of fire (based on its surface area and height). If less than 10 cubic yards of fire is present, the God can increase the present amount of fire to fill that volume. For each additional Legend point he spends, the God can increase the amount of fire under his control by 10 more cubic yards. (The God can spend no more additional points of Legend beyond the mandatory five than he has dots of Legend.) The God can move and shape fire under his control in all three dimensions\u2014lifting it off the ground entirely or making it take any three-dimensional shape he desires. He can even mold the fire into a recognizable shape and have it take actions."
