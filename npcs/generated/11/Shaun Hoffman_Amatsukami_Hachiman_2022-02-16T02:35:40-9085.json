When she removes the relic, she finds its kami disoriented and confused, unsure of where it is or who has possession of it. The Scion\u2019s player then makes a (Manipulation + Occult) roll for the character to convince the disoriented spirit that it has been recovered by its rightful master. If the roll succeeds, the relic functions for the Scion who\u2019s taken possession of it just as it normally does for the Scion for whom it was originally intended. That is, the Scion thief can make full use of the Boons normally accessed through it without her player having to make the Legend roll described in regards to Stolen Relics. The relic\u2019s kami remains disoriented and helpful for a number of days equal to the successes rolled to confuse it, at which point it comes to its senses and realizes how it\u2019s been tricked."
