                "Prerequisite Knack: Crushing Grip (Scion: Hero, p. 126) Extrapolated from learning to exert tremendous pressure from all manner of holds and contortions, the Scion develops the ability to put her massive strength to good use on a single, small point. With just a flick of a finger, a jab of an elbow or a headbutt, the Scion delivers the entire force of her Epic Strength. Although this doesn\u2019t necessarily change the Scion\u2019s unarmed combat style \u2014 she still needs to land a strike on an enemy \u2014 it\u2019s quite intimidating when she can simply poke a building and cause an entire wall to crumble. Similarly, if the Scion is somehow restrained but able to move even a minuscule part of her body, she could (for instance) flick a tiny rock with her toe with enough force to kill a man. While this does not increase the Scion\u2019s damage output, it means that even when bound or restricted from moving in some way, the Scion can still bring all of her Epic Strength to bear in an attack. Perhaps she\u2019s chained with bindings made from Gleipnir and can\u2019t break them, but she can head-butt her assailant. Maybe she is buried in rock and can only move her little finger but can use that to send the boulder on the top of the heap flying. Her damage output and ability to lift are not impinged in any way when she\u2019s forced to rely only on a single limb, a part of her body or a restricted range of motion. Activating this Knack costs three points of Legend. Its effects last for a single application.",

            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Command \nCost: 5+ Legend \nWith this Boon, a God turns faithful mortal worshipers into powerful servants of living flame. If the mortals are willing to undergo the transformation, the God lays a hand on each mortal\u2019s forehead and imbues him or her with the spirit of the living flame. In a moment of intense, unutterable pain, the mortal spasms and collapses with his veins glowing white hot through his skin and smoke pouring from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth. A moment later, the mortal\u2019s flesh burns away entirely and he rises as a blackened skeleton surrounded by swirling yellow fire. To activate this Boon, the God\u2019s player spends five Legend points and rolls (Charisma + Command). With the base activation, the God can transform a number of willing mortals equal to his Legend. Each additional Legend point he spends adds another number of willing mortals equal to his Legend."

With this Boon, a Scion removes both necessities from a single flame for one scene. He could keep a single torch (or even a match) lit for hours as he explores a dark labyrinth. He could cause the tiny spark at the end of a fuse to burn in place without moving. This Boon is also good for keeping a source of flame from consuming the breathable air in an enclosed space."

No amount of collapsing rubble can break the Scion\u2019s bones (or the Birthright itself), and he won\u2019t suffocate no matter how much dirt piles onto him. If he lacks the strength to free himself, however, he does run the risk of either starving to death or dying of thirst if no one digs him out. Yet, it would not be the earth that kills him, but his own lack of fortitude."

The weapon can be of any shape and size, but the distinction is largely a matter of personal taste, rather than available traits. These weapons do not use the normal traits from the chart in Scion: Hero. Instead, when the character removes the weapon from the fire, the player receives a base number of points equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend for each weapon. These points can add to a base Accuracy +0, Damage +0 and Defense -1, and they can subtract from a starting Speed 6 (reducing it to a minimum of 1).

The armor the coating of particles creates has a bashing and lethal Hardness and soak equal to half the Scion\u2019s Legend (rounded up), as well as a mobility penalty equal to that of riot gear.

To take control of the fire, the God need only stare into it and spend Legend points. When he does so, the fire becomes a three-dimensional mass that he can manipulate in all three dimensions in any way his imagination can conceive. For five Legend points, the God can manipulate 10 cubic yards of fire (based on its surface area and height). If less than 10 cubic yards of fire is present, the God can increase the present amount of fire to fill that volume. For each additional Legend point he spends, the God can increase the amount of fire under his control by 10 more cubic yards.

While many advanced powers can overcome the immunity of beings with lower Legend ratings, a power enhanced with Hotter than Hot suffers no such limitation: It cuts right though fire resistance like it\u2019s not there. In fact, the supercharged flames that a God wields in conjunction with this Boon are so deadly, they can injure or kill creatures that are made entirely of fire. Whether it\u2019s another Scion in Devil Body form or an Ifrit, fire elemental or salamander, beings that normally enjoy total protection from fire now realize what \u201cscorching\u201d really means."
