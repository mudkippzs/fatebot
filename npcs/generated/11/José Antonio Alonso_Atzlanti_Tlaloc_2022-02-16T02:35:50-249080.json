Unlike Serpent\u2019s Gaze, though, the Scion need not consciously maintain eye contact with her victim for the effect to endure. Once the victim has been trans\ufb01xed by the Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance, he remains thus until either the end of the scene or until the Scion leaves his line of sight.

The star-struck victim tries to move to a nearby room, balcony, Jacuzzi or other spot as instructed, in hopes that the Scion will soon arrive. The power of the Knack does all of the convincing. The Scion\u2019s player simply spends one Legend point and picks a single recipient, as with the Come Hither Knack.

                "As Scions build up ever more dots of Epic Appearance, they grow ever more unearthly. As such, whether they\u2019re beautiful or quite the opposite, it becomes increasingly difficult to deal with mortal humans on their level. The Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance can\u2019t help but get in the way. This Knack, however, mitigates that factor. When the Scion\u2019s player spends a point of Willpower to activate it for the scene, any mortals who see the character completely ignore his Appearance score (both Epic and mundane). Witnesses might vaguely remember that a beautiful Scion was kind of pretty or that a disgustingly ugly Scion was dirty and a little scary, but that\u2019s it. They won\u2019t recognize the Scion again later unless the Scion uses this Knack in their presence again, and they won\u2019t be able to describe the Scion in great detail to anyone else. They might get height, hair color, skin tone, build and style of dress right, but details beyond those generalities prove elusive. Scions themselves are immune to this effect, as they are more than capable of dealing with the extremes that Epic Appearance represents. This Knack lasts for the scene, though the Scion can choose to turn off the effect before then.

Spending a point of Legend and a point of Willpower, the Scion burns a mental vision of himself so deeply into the victim\u2019s mind that everyone the victim sees thereafter who\u2019s of the same sex as the Scion seems to be wearing the Scion\u2019s face. This effect is especially jarring because other features such as height, weight, hairstyle, skin tone and whatnot don\u2019t change from what\u2019s natural for the person the victim is actually seeing. Only the Scion\u2019s face stands out, sized and colored as appropriate for the person on hand, yet still undeniably the Scion\u2019s own. Shaking off this disorienting hallucination costs the victim a point of Willpower, but that doesn\u2019t end the effect. An hour later, the effect creeps back up on the victim until every person of the appropriate gender has the Scion\u2019s face again. Even worse, a character cannot regain spent Willpower points while he\u2019s languishing under this effect. The only hope for a mortal victim is that the Scion will track him down and decide to end the effect. The demigod can do the same for Scion victims as well, but in the children of the Gods, the effect will wear off on its own after the victim has spent 24 hours with no points of Willpower.",
