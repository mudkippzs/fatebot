(People this ugly rarely have friends, anyway). To activate Do Not Want, the Scion\u2019s player expends three Legend points, then rolls (Appearance + Presence + Legend). Whenever someone first tries to attack or lay hands on the Scion, the aggressor\u2019s player must roll (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). If the attacker scores more successes than the Scion\u2019s player, his character\u2019s actions proceed as normal. If he scores fewer successes than the Scion, then the difference becomes a bonus to the Scion\u2019s DV against the attacker. This bonus persists for the rest of the scene. For example, if the Scion\u2019s player scores 6 successes on the (Appearance + Presence + Legend) roll and an attacker only manages to eke out 3 successes on his (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll, then the Scion gains a +3 bonus to DV against that attacker for the rest of the scene. This benefit applies against everyone who tries to take action against the Scion for the rest of the scene, though each attacker makes a separate resistance roll.

With Microscopic Precision, the Scion\u2019s ability to control fine manipulation becomes so highly attenuated that she can manipulate materials on an absurdly small scale. Armed with nothing more than a pair of tweezers and her own tremendously controlled digits, the Scion can separate dust particles, tweeze out bacteria by hand with a microscope or pluck a tiny corrupting titanspawn hair from a wound, all without disturbing anything around the item. Similarly, the Scion can disable an alarm or a bomb just by teasing out the wires by hand, separate out the threads of the Golden Fleece with her fingers and never lose at the game of Operation.

Before he lets loose, the Scion re\ufb02exively takes in the contours of the surroundings (as the player spends a point of Legend).

The Scion\u2019s throw can incorporate a number of ricochets equal to his Epic Dexterity dots, and each ricochet negates a point of DV modi\ufb01er that comes from cover or a shield. If the Scion is trying to not only hit the target but also disarm him or otherwise show off (more so), each ricochet can mitigate the penalty for doing so as well if he has ricochets left over. The general rule here is that one ricochet takes away one point of penalty on the throw\u2019s roll due to cover, a shield, showing off or attempting to disarm the target.
