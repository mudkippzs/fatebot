                "Scions of Hel are almost always awesomely hideous, while Scions of Aphrodite are generally phenomenally attractive. With this Knack, though, a Scion can have the best of both worlds. Once a Scion chooses this Knack, she can shift her Epic Appearance from hideous to beautiful at will. The player simply expends the requisite Legend cost and the Scion\u2019s mien transforms. In either form, she is still recognizable as herself; she cannot use this Knack to change her appearance, unless she also has a Knack like Detail Variation from p. 71 of Scion: God. However, she can change from an elegant, refined woman to a vengeful, nerve-wracking hag in the blink of an eye. Once she transforms thus, her range of available Epic Appearance Knacks shifts as appropriate. While beautiful, then, the Scion can invoke all of her known Epic Appearance Knacks that rely on great beauty; while hideous, she can invoke any of her Epic Appearance Knacks that require a monstrous countenance. Once a Scion learns this Knack, she can freely purchase any Epic Appearance Knack that would normally require incredible beauty or incredible monstrosity. She can only use the Knacks appropriate to the form that she currently bears, though. Activating this Knack costs three points of Legend. The Scion remains in her switched state until she decides to activate the Knack again. (Indeed, both of them are her \u201cnatural\u201d state; she simply has the ability to swap between them as desired.)"

As such, whether they\u2019re beautiful or quite the opposite, it becomes increasingly difficult to deal with mortal humans on their level.

When the Scion\u2019s player spends a point of Willpower to activate it for the scene, any mortals who see the character completely ignore his Appearance score (both Epic and mundane). Witnesses might vaguely remember that a beautiful Scion was kind of pretty or that a disgustingly ugly Scion was dirty and a little scary, but that\u2019s it. They won\u2019t recognize the Scion again later unless the Scion uses this Knack in their presence again, and they won\u2019t be able to describe the Scion in great detail to anyone else.

            "Dice Pool: Stamina + Medicine \nCost: 3 Legend \nBy touching a male or female, the Scion guarantees that the next act of sexual intercourse in which that the person engages that could result in offspring does result in offspring. An affected male definitely impregnates the next female he has sex with if she is even theoretically capable of having children; an affected female definitely becomes pregnant from the next male with whom she has sex. Even infertile participants become temporarily fertile, and birth control devices fail. A Scion may use this Boon automatically on himself or any unresisting mortal animal or human. Consciously unwilling subjects may resist with a (Stamina + Fortitude) roll against the Scion\u2019s (Stamina + Medicine). Titanspawn, Scions other than the user, and other supernatural beings are always considered unwilling even if they would welcome the Boon\u2019s effect, for their supernatural aspect inherently resists the power. Undead and similar creatures are (thankfully) unaffected."

The player rolls (Stamina + Survival) and spends one Legend, and any blight or infestation ends immediately. Blight clears up as if it had never occurred, and vermin suddenly find the affected plants unappealing. This Boon affects a number of large plants (or a number of square yards of a patch of smaller plants) equal to the successes achieved on the roll. This Boon doesn\u2019t protect against future blights, and it stops only the current generation of vermin infestation."

            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Art \nCost: 2 Legend \nAn oft-overlooked element of the Sky Purview is the fact that air carries sound. The most graphic example of this is thunder, which is commonly associated with sky gods; wind, too, is said to howl or moan, as if the sky itself has a voice. A demigod who delves into the nature of thunder and sound can learn to manipulate the currents of air that carry sound and thereby enhance or dampen sonic effects."

His appearance does not change, but solid objects pass through him as if he were a visible ghost, and his touch is cold like the caress of fog. He becomes impervious to physical damage, and he can squeeze his transformed body through the narrowest gaps. In this form, he can also fly. While he\u2019s flying, he can interact with clouds as if they were as solid as earth. If he should find a sufficiently large bank of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds and use Cloud Sculptor (Sky \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022) on them, he could build himself a castle in the air."

First, he can perform the eponymous action, surrounding himself with pure, breathable air. With five Legend, the God can breathe out 1,000 cubic yards of pure air per dot of Legend he has. (At the minimum, that\u2019s a sphere with a roughly 13-yard radius or a cube with roughly 21-yard sides.) This volume moves with the God, taking whatever shape he desires, and it remains breathable and clean for a number of hours equal to the successes on the activation roll. Using this Boon this way can also accomplish such feats as clearing an area of smoke or poisonous gas, creating a bubble of breathable air underwater or busting the seams on an airtight cell."

Alternatively, she can curse the land with a blight that either kills the plants within it outright or makes them so attractive to vermin that the resulting infestation has the same effect. The Scion\u2019s player spends three Legend and rolls (Stamina + Survival). The number of successes she rolls determines how many acres she can affect with this power. If one Scion wants to use an aspect of this Boon on a patch of land on which another Scion has used the opposite aspect, a contested roll is called for. Whoever achieves more successes spreads her effect over the larger area, canceling out the lesser effect."

(It doesn\u2019t matter which stone or metal it is, except aesthetically.) When he does so, his body instantly changes into a statue made of that material. Becoming a statue thus offers an all-purpose Hardness value equal to the character\u2019s Legend, and adds a like value to his bashing and lethal soak. The transformation also adds 15 pounds per dot of Legend he has to the character\u2019s weight. He can still move and support his weight despite what limits his Strength might impose, but structures and other people might not be able to do so as easily. This transformation lasts for one scene at most."

            "Dice Pool: Dexterity + Stealth \nCost: 1 Legend \nWhen the Scion hides in her verdant element, it\u2019s almost impossible to find her. Her skin sprouts grass, bark, underbrush, flowers, mushrooms or what have you that allow her to blend in seamlessly with her natural surroundings. As long as she doesn\u2019t move or otherwise draw attention to herself, mundane attempts to find or track her fail automatically. A mortal hunter with a trusty hound could walk right over the Scion\u2019s disguised back and never know she was there. Hunters of supernatural prowess fare only a little better. Those with the Epic Perception Knack Predatory Focus or a Survival Arete can attempt to track the hidden Scion\u2019s movements, their players rolling (Perception + Survival) against the hiding Scion\u2019s activation roll. Even if they get more successes than the Scion\u2019s player did, though, the hunters find only the general area in which the Scion is hiding. (They come to an area within a number of yards equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend but lose track of her unless she moves again.) Only hunters with the Supernal Hunter Knack are actually skilled enough to find a Scion who\u2019s using this Boon to hide (and only if their rolls garner more successes than the Scion\u2019s)."
