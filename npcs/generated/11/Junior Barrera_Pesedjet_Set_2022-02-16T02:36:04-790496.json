The prerequisite Knack enables him to in\ufb02ict lethal damage during a clinch that he controls, and this Knack builds on that to awful effect. If the Scion spends a point of Legend during a clinch, he can make a single attack in\ufb02ict aggravated damage instead of lethal. What\u2019s more, his normal unarmed combat attacks now in\ufb02ict lethal damage instead of bashing damage. Keep in mind that that lethal damage is now the standard damage he in\ufb02icts unarmed, regardless of whether he spends the point of Legend to make a single clinch\u2019s damage aggravated. The Scion can pull his punches and in\ufb02ict only bashing damage if he wants to, but doing so incurs the \u201cFlat of the Blade\u201d rule from page 199 of Scion: Hero.",

A Scion can use this Knack to hold up any weight she can lift or keep a creature that\u2019s fastened to a rope or line from getting away. By tightening her neck muscles, she could even hang by her neck without suffocating. The Scion must stay virtually immobile, however. A Scion could keep a mine from caving in, hang from a noose for days or drag a chained beast slowly toward her, but she could not run, jump or perform most combat actions. A Scion is still limited by her normal and Epic Strength ratings, though she can perform feats at the top of her capabilities for days using this Knack.
