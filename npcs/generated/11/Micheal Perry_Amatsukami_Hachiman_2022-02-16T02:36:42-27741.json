Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool. He must claim the God\u2019s authority when he does so, speaking in the divine figure\u2019s holy name. Characters with this Knack can use it on any willing emissary of equal or lesser Legend. (As the messenger of the Dodekatheon, for instance, Hermes has been a frequent recipient of this effect.) Its remote effect works on a single listener or on a whole group of people. Also, the character\u2019s instructions to her emissary cannot run counter to the effect of the Charisma-based roll she intends to bestow upon that emissary. She cannot, for instance, prepare what looks like a stirring battlefield address on paper but is actually intended to demoralize the troops through whom her chosen generals speaks.",

Not only can he make an animal bigger, stronger and tougher, he can also make it faster, more beautiful, more charming or wiser. For one Willpower and three Legend points, he can increase any of the beast\u2019s Mental or Social Attributes by one dot. He can also increase its Dexterity by one dot for the same cost. This Boon can no more than double the beast\u2019s original Dexterity. Increases to its Mental and Social Attributes are limited to the human maximum of five dots."
