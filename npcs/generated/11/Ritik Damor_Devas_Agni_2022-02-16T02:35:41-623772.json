Mortals cannot resist the effect or the compulsion to perform the implanted action.

If the person trying to hit the target is a Scion with this Knack, however, not even such measures guarantee total safety. Before he lets loose, the Scion re\ufb02exively takes in the contours of the surroundings (as the player spends a point of Legend). He then throws his item in a seemingly random direction that nonetheless sends it ringing and bouncing off nearby surfaces to completely circumvent the target\u2019s cover or shield, thus negating its DV bonus. The Scion\u2019s throw can incorporate a number of ricochets equal to his Epic Dexterity dots, and each ricochet negates a point of DV modi\ufb01er that comes from cover or a shield. If the Scion is trying to not only hit the target but also disarm him or otherwise show off (more so), each ricochet can mitigate the penalty for doing so as well if he has ricochets left over. The general rule here is that one ricochet takes away one point of penalty on the throw\u2019s roll due to cover, a shield, showing off or attempting to disarm the target. When the thrown item \ufb01nally hits the target, it does so at its full force, regardless of how many times it bounced off walls, \ufb02oors, light \ufb01xtures, other enemies\u2019 helmets or what have you.
