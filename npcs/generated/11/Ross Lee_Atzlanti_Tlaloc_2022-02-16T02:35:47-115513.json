If the attacker scores more successes than the Scion\u2019s player, his character\u2019s actions proceed as normal.

For example, if the Scion\u2019s player scores 6 successes on the (Appearance + Presence + Legend) roll and an attacker only manages to eke out 3 successes on his (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll, then the Scion gains a +3 bonus to DV against that attacker for the rest of the scene. This benefit applies against everyone who tries to take action against the Scion for the rest of the scene, though each attacker makes a separate resistance roll.

            "Dice Pool: Stamina + Survival \nCost: 2 Legend per plant/patch \nThe Goddess touches a single plant and imbues its natural surroundings with her blessing. In so doing, she grants the plants of that area eternal life, regardless of environment or nutrition. Short of being set ablaze or physically torn apart, the affected plants grow to their full size in the normal time and remain alive and well thereafter. A Goddess can imbue eternal life into a single square mile of plant life per two Legend points her player spends\u2014up to a maximum number of square miles equal to the success her player makes on the (Stamina + Survival) activation roll. Once an area has been affected with this Boon, it remains in full bloom. Any small plant or piece of a larger plant that is broken or removed grows back within 24 hours."

To use it, the Scion raises a hand heavenward or points his Birthright weapon at his intended foe. At his behest, lightning either lances down from the sky or launches from the weapon itself to smite the victim. Each such bolt inflicts 15 dice of lethal damage plus extra successes on the Marksmanship roll. An attack that inflicts damage also inflicts knockdown or knockback automatically."

This cloud swirls around him and accumulates on his body like a suit of plate armor plus helmet. Any earthen substance will suffice, from gravel to mud to sand. The armor the coating of particles creates has a bashing and lethal Hardness and soak equal to half the Scion\u2019s Legend (rounded up), as well as a mobility penalty equal to that of riot gear. It lasts for the rest of the scene, at the end of which it shatters into a million pieces and falls at the Scion\u2019s feet.

No amount of collapsing rubble can break the Scion\u2019s bones (or the Birthright itself), and he won\u2019t suffocate no matter how much dirt piles onto him.

A rusted metal object loses durability and functionality. Its Hardness decreases to half normal, and if the object is a precision item (like a gun), it has a 50% chance to malfunction any time it\u2019s used. Restoring a rusted item to its original state wipes away all traces of age and even reverses the effects, so that a wholly rusted-out car body (for instance) would be as good as new. The rusted parts don\u2019t just disappear, they reverse the process and become solid metal again. Invoking this power on an item requires the Scion to physically touch or manipulate the object, and it has no effect on metals that don\u2019t rust (such as gold) or upon Relics."

Becoming a statue thus offers an all-purpose Hardness value equal to the character\u2019s Legend, and adds a like value to his bashing and lethal soak. The transformation also adds 15 pounds per dot of Legend he has to the character\u2019s weight. He can still move and support his weight despite what limits his Strength might impose, but structures and other people might not be able to do so as easily.
