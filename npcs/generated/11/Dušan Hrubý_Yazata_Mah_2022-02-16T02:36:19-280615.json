Yet, it\u2019s undeniably sweeter to let some pompous douchebag take the first swing and then utterly annihilate him with a cunning verbal riposte. To hit an attacker with a devastating comeback costs a single point of Legend. Doing so strips the victim of all of his spent Willpower points and doesn\u2019t allow him to recoup those lost points for one full day. A character can use this Knack to defend herself from a use of Opening Salvo if she has the Legend point to spend and her comeback is timely enough. A victim, however, can defend himself from a use of this Knack if he also uses this Knack. (He can retort without using the Knack, of course, but he still suffers the effect.) If two characters use this Knack in a verbal exchange, they can activate it once apiece and then trade insults until one scores a decisive hit over the other. If that victim\u2019s comeback is weaker than the one before it, he loses the impromptu contest and the Willpower points. As with Opening Salvo, the player must actually come up with a retort reasonably quickly. She doesn\u2019t have to be Hamlet running circles around Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, she just has to give it the old college try.

The aura of the Amesha Spenta flows off her body to coalesce as an abstract humanoid figure formed of the physical principle of the Amesha Spenta (i.e., fire for Asha Vahishta, water for Haurvetat, etc.) \nThe Amesha Spenta has all the Scion\u2019s dice pools and can use all the Boons that the Scion knows from the relevant purview. It acts by the Scion\u2019s will, but takes its own actions. As an abstract concept given form, though, the mystic helper cannot do anything but move and use Boons. It also uses the Scion\u2019s Legend to power those Boons. No mundane force can harm an Amesha Spenta, but attacks backed by Epic Attributes, Arete, or other supernatural means deal damage as normal. The Amesha Spenta has soak equal to the Scion\u2019s natural soak (including Epic Stamina) and it has five \u20130 Health levels. \nThis Boon may be used once per scene. The Amesha Spenta lasts for one minute per success on the activation roll. \nThe Scion may also select a fifth Amesha Spenta to associate with Asha, as per the previous Boon."
