                "Prerequisite Knack: Holy Bound (Scion: Hero, p. 126) A character with this Knack cannot necessarily fly, but the difference between using this Knack and flying is a subtlety that is easily lost on mortal onlookers. For the cost of 10 Legend points, this Knack converts the distance increment a character can jump from yards to hundreds of yards. That is, the character can leap the distance of one football field straight up for every dot of (Strength + Athletics) she has plus the bonus number granted by her Epic Strength. She can jump twice that length horizontally. At Strength 12, Athletics 5 and Epic Strength 10 (plus accounting for this Knack\u2019s prerequisite), the character can leap a little bit more than seven miles straight up \u2014 which is about one and a half miles higher than the peak of Mount Everest \u2014 or more than 14 miles horizontally. Used in combat, this Knack makes jumping something more than a Speed 5 miscellaneous action. When a character takes a leap that can potentially carry her for miles, that action is typically narrated rather than played out tick by tick. If no one can fly after her, leap after her or run fast enough to keep up with her, the character effectively leaves combat. In \u201cflight,\u201d the character retains her full DVs and attack dice pools. This Knack also makes jumping more dangerous than it normally is. Normally, a character can always safely fall from the maximum height to which she can normally jump. This Knack, however, overrides that safety standard by extending a person\u2019s jumping height to preposterous extremes. If a character who uses this Knack to leap aeronautically is successfully attacked in flight and that attack inflicts enough damage to cause knockdown or knockback, the character\u2019s prodigious leap turns into an uncontrolled fall. The player gets one chance per dot of Epic Strength the character has to succeed on a (Dexterity + Athletics) roll. If she does succeed, the character retains her aerial poise and lands, if not gracefully, at least safely. If the roll fails, the character suffers damage relevant to falling from a great height.",

                "The Scion is so strong that he can direct his incredible power through the ground or \ufb02oor to affect enemies at range. Doing so takes two separate forms. First, the character can stomp or strike the ground with his \ufb01sts or a weapon, which sends a shock wave outward from him along the ground across an area with a radius equal to his Epic Strength in yards. Striking the ground thus to send out the shock wave requires a Strength roll, which receives the bene\ufb01t of his Epic Strength. Potential victims \u2014 friend and foe alike \u2014 compare their Dodge DV to the results of this roll. If their DV overcomes the Scion\u2019s successes, they manage to jump and let the shock wave pass beneath them. If their DV isn\u2019t high enough, they immediately suffer knockdown as well as an amount of bashing damage equal to however many of the Scion\u2019s successes their DV couldn\u2019t cancel out. (If his allies know the Scion is about to use this Knack \u2014 if his using it is part of a coordinated assault, for instance \u2014 they can jump out of the way preemptively without having to rely on their DVs.) This attack in\ufb02icts no damage on the \ufb02oor or the ground the Scion strikes. All the energy is expended into the shock wave. The second form this power takes is more selective and deliberate. As with the \ufb01rst form, the Scion strikes the ground and sends a shock wave along the surface out to a distance equal to his Epic Strength in yards. This time, though, his player makes a standard Dexterity-based attack roll and targets a single opponent. If that opponent\u2019s Dodge DV isn\u2019t high enough to get him out of the way of the attack, the Scion\u2019s player then makes a Strength roll, modi\ufb01ed by his Epic Strength but not modi\ufb01ed by his extra successes on the attack roll. The damage this attack in\ufb02icts is bashing, but it has one other effect that renders the victim almost helpless for a moment afterward. Any successes on the Strength roll that exceed the victim\u2019s soak not only in\ufb02ict damage but also hurl the victim straight up in the air (one yard per unsoaked success). The victim\u2019s rise and fall takes six ticks, during which his DVs are considered to be halved. He can make ranged attacks at a -5 penalty, but he can\u2019t move or jump or do much of anything until he lands again. In fact, if the Scion\u2019s attack sends him high enough in the air, the victim might take damage from crashing back down from so great a height. Using either form of this Knack requires the expenditure of one Legend point.",

                "Prerequisite Knack: Blurt It Out (Scion: Hero, p. 131) This Knack is similar to the Epic Charisma Knack called Borrowed Credibility (pp. 67-68) in that it allows a character to exert her Epic Attribute remotely through an agent or emissary. Doing so costs three Legend points and the player rolls her character\u2019s Manipulation-based dice pool. She then confers on a single emissary the results of that roll, including any bonus successes from Epic Manipulation, and instructs that emissary to try to convince someone of something important on her behalf. When the emissary goes to the intended person and tries to do as the Scion said, he uses the Scion\u2019s Manipulation roll instead of that of his own social roll. If the character actually wants the emissary to achieve the goal she tells the emissary to achieve, her player can simply roll the appropriate Manipulation-based dice pool and let her result substitute for what would be the emissary\u2019s roll of the same dice pool. Unlike with Borrowed Credibility, though, the character with this Knack can seed an effect in the emissary that is quite different from the one the emissary is instructed to use. In neither case does the emissary\u2019s player make the Manipulation-based roll himself. He simply says the words and lets the results of the conferred roll have their desired effect on the listener. The listener believes, however, that his decision is based solely on the emissary\u2019s efforts and remains unaware of the manipulator\u2019s influence.

Attempting to hypnotize a fellow Scion of lesser or equal (Willpower + Legend) requires not only a Willpower expenditure but a (Manipulation + Command + Legend) roll contested against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend).
