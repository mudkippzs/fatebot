Thus, if she\u2019s filled in the first four boxes of her health levels, the Scion gains a +2 bonus on all of her appropriate rolls instead of taking the normal -2 penalty. Even if her Epic Stamina would obviate the penalty in whole or in part, she still gains the full bonus. Scions whose Epic Stamina grants them additional health levels count those boxes as having a -4 penalty (and thus a +4 bonus for purposes of this Knack). Furthermore, every time a Scion using Raging Bull suffers an injury (be it a single level of bashing damage or ten levels of aggravated damage), the player may choose to spend one point of Legend to restore one expended point of Willpower.

                "Prerequisite Knack: Trick Shooter (Scion: Hero, p. 128) When fighting against fearsome titanspawn with armored hides, scaly skin or chitinous shells, sometimes a Scion has to aim for a very precise spot. Indeed, it was just such a weak spot that was the downfall of Achilles. Naturally, that sort of precision can be hard to achieve in the heat of battle, especially against a target with a supernaturally impressive defense. With the steady aim provided by Shot to the Heart, though, a Scion never needs to worry about hitting a small patch of exposed flesh, a vulnerable tendon or an eye between blinks \u2014 his attacks excel at finding the weak point. While Shot to the Heart is active, the Scion reduces any penalty for attacking a specific weak point by an amount up to his Epic Dexterity score. That is, if a giant turtle-like titanspawn has a weak spot in its soft underbelly, but striking the unarmored area has a difficulty of 5 and the attacking Scion has an Epic Dexterity of 3, then the Scion reduces the difficulty of making such a targeted shot to difficulty 2. Shot to the Heart can\u2019t reduce the added difficulty of a targeted shot to less than zero \u2014 making an attack on a vital spot is never easier than just hitting the damn thing. Also, Shot to the Heart doesn\u2019t give the Scion any innate knowledge of where a vital spot might be; it just lets him target the spot more effectively if he knows where to find one. While Shot to the Heart requires a Knack typically used with ranged combat as a prerequisite, this Knack can be used with any of the Scion\u2019s attacks.

Before he lets loose, the Scion re\ufb02exively takes in the contours of the surroundings (as the player spends a point of Legend).

The Scion\u2019s throw can incorporate a number of ricochets equal to his Epic Dexterity dots, and each ricochet negates a point of DV modi\ufb01er that comes from cover or a shield. If the Scion is trying to not only hit the target but also disarm him or otherwise show off (more so), each ricochet can mitigate the penalty for doing so as well if he has ricochets left over. The general rule here is that one ricochet takes away one point of penalty on the throw\u2019s roll due to cover, a shield, showing off or attempting to disarm the target.
