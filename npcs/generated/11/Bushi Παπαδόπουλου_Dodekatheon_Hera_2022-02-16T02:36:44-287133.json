With a few well-chosen words to reinforce the subject\u2019s awareness of the situation, though, a Scion with this Knack can help people snap out of the unnatural influence of others. The player spends Legend equal to the cost of the power being countered plus one (plus an additional three Legend for every point of Willpower spent on the power being countered), then rolls (Manipulation + Presence + Legend). If the player rolls more successes than the original command, the subject immediately snaps out of it and realizes that he didn\u2019t want to do whatever it is that he was compelled to do. If the original power didn\u2019t require a roll to succeed (like Overt Order), then the Scion\u2019s player must simply score a number of successes equal to the original commander\u2019s (Manipulation + Command + Legend). In order to countermand a specific Epic Charisma or Epic Manipulation Knack, the Scion using Deprogramming must also know the Knack being used. That is, using Deprogramming to stop Overt Order requires that the Scion performing the countermand must also know Overt Order.
