If a berserker hopped up on Jotunblut or a thrall full of eitr tries to split the Scion\u2019s skull with a \ufb01 re ax, the Scion can take the blow on his forearm and knock it aside without serious injury. (That assumes the character\u2019s Parry DV is suf\ufb01cient to cancel out the attack roll\u2019s successes, of course.) While that bene\ufb01t remains in effect all the time, the Scion can also engage a temporary one that offers even more protection. With the expenditure of a Legend point, a measure of the Scion\u2019s ichor wells up from within and coats the Scion\u2019s body. This coating hardens into a gleaming, metallic armor that\u2019s no thicker than a hair\u2019s breadth. This armor has a bashing and lethal soak equal to the character\u2019s Legend, and it in\ufb02icts a mobility penalty of only -1. The ichor coating is thin enough to \ufb01 t comfortably beneath one\u2019s clothing, so it adds its protective value to that of any other armor the character might already be wearing. Natural armor from this Knack lasts for only one scene and disintegrates at the scene\u2019s end.",

Fortunately, a Scion with this Knack need not fear the punishment of changes in pressure or atmosphere. While the Scion must still breathe, she doesn\u2019t have to worry about the bends, explosive decompression or the crushing force of a deep undersea trench. Her body naturally and instinctively adjusts to account for all changes in pressure. Under Pressure can\u2019t protect a Scion against bruising and crushing damage: If she\u2019s stuck in the aforementioned Titanic gullet, she\u2019ll have to use other abilities to deal with the digestive action and the acid.

A character with Devourer can safely eat literally anything she can force down her gullet. With both Knacks, no poison or toxin in what she eats or drinks has any effect on her. Internal Refinery expands that latter protection to not only poisons or toxins she eats, but all poisons and toxins she\u2019s exposed to, as well as any diseases that mortal flesh might suffer. In addition, a character with this Knack can refine any poison, toxin or disease to which she is exposed into a single dose of an antidote for that substance or cure to that affliction. If the character spits this antidote or cure out and administers it to an afflicted patient, it completely erases one dose or one exposure to the hazardous substance in the patient\u2019s system. The character must administer this treatment within one scene of the patient\u2019s exposure, and within one action of when she (the character with this Knack) refines the substance into a dose of its cure. The cure doesn\u2019t heal damage from the exposure, but it purges it completely. Refining the deleterious material costs five Legend points per dose.",
