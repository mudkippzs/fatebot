                "Prerequisite Knack: Instant Hypnosis (Scion: Demigod, p. 61) Once a character with this Knack\u2019s prerequisite has mesmerized a single victim, he can alter or create from whole cloth a memory in the victim\u2019s mind rather than compelling the victim to perform some later action. Doing the former involves talking the victim through some genuine memory and \u201ccorrecting\u201d details as they come out. Creating a false memory from whole cloth is simply a matter of the character describing the \u201cremembered\u201d events to the victim and telling her when and where those events occurred. False or altered memories replace the originals in the victim\u2019s mind, erasing what was in their place originally. The cost, dice pool, restrictions and resistance mechanics of this Knack are the same as for Instant Hypnosis. If the victim is mortal (or another type of extra), she won\u2019t ever accept that her new memories are false. She might think she was on drugs at the time or was hallucinating with fever, but she clings to the belief that the memory is genuine. Characters with a Legend rating will assume as mortals do unless they are confronted with evidence to suggest the memories are false. Even then, however, they still cannot get their original memories back.",

The star-struck victim tries to move to a nearby room, balcony, Jacuzzi or other spot as instructed, in hopes that the Scion will soon arrive. The power of the Knack does all of the convincing. The Scion\u2019s player simply spends one Legend point and picks a single recipient, as with the Come Hither Knack. As usual, the intended recipient must be able to see an image of the Scion, must understand that the message is for her and must have a reasonable idea of how to find him. Meet Me Backstage doesn\u2019t interrupt a subject\u2019s self-preservation any more than Come Hither does: While the subject makes all due haste to reach the appointed meeting place, \u201cdue haste\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cdie along the way.\u201d Nevertheless, this Knack is excellent for discreet rendezvous as well as setting up a poor sap for a beat-down party.

                "Scions of Hel are almost always awesomely hideous, while Scions of Aphrodite are generally phenomenally attractive. With this Knack, though, a Scion can have the best of both worlds. Once a Scion chooses this Knack, she can shift her Epic Appearance from hideous to beautiful at will. The player simply expends the requisite Legend cost and the Scion\u2019s mien transforms. In either form, she is still recognizable as herself; she cannot use this Knack to change her appearance, unless she also has a Knack like Detail Variation from p. 71 of Scion: God. However, she can change from an elegant, refined woman to a vengeful, nerve-wracking hag in the blink of an eye. Once she transforms thus, her range of available Epic Appearance Knacks shifts as appropriate. While beautiful, then, the Scion can invoke all of her known Epic Appearance Knacks that rely on great beauty; while hideous, she can invoke any of her Epic Appearance Knacks that require a monstrous countenance. Once a Scion learns this Knack, she can freely purchase any Epic Appearance Knack that would normally require incredible beauty or incredible monstrosity. She can only use the Knacks appropriate to the form that she currently bears, though. Activating this Knack costs three points of Legend. The Scion remains in her switched state until she decides to activate the Knack again. (Indeed, both of them are her \u201cnatural\u201d state; she simply has the ability to swap between them as desired.)"

When the effect wears off, the affected victims are unable to explain what came over them, and are likely embarrassed by letting their feelings run away with them like that.
