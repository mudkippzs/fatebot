For a single attack that the Scion doesn\u2019t see, hear or otherwise perceive coming, the Scion can spend a point of Legend and a point of Willpower to completely ignore it as if it never happened (thereby suffering no damage from it). Of course the attack does actually happen\u2014any ammunition used is spent, onlookers might be covered with the Scion\u2019s blood, the would-be assassin might be standing right there holding a dripping knife\u2014but such concerns are immaterial to the Scion victim.
