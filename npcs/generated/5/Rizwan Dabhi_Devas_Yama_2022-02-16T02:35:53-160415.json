A character with Devourer can safely eat literally anything she can force down her gullet. With both Knacks, no poison or toxin in what she eats or drinks has any effect on her. Internal Refinery expands that latter protection to not only poisons or toxins she eats, but all poisons and toxins she\u2019s exposed to, as well as any diseases that mortal flesh might suffer. In addition, a character with this Knack can refine any poison, toxin or disease to which she is exposed into a single dose of an antidote for that substance or cure to that affliction. If the character spits this antidote or cure out and administers it to an afflicted patient, it completely erases one dose or one exposure to the hazardous substance in the patient\u2019s system. The character must administer this treatment within one scene of the patient\u2019s exposure, and within one action of when she (the character with this Knack) refines the substance into a dose of its cure. The cure doesn\u2019t heal damage from the exposure, but it purges it completely. Refining the deleterious material costs five Legend points per dose.",

                "<Prerequisites> Fast Learner (Scion: Hero, p. 135), Star Pupil (Scion: Demigod, p. 65) Ancient Gods with a particular joy for creation, such as Ptah and Hephaestus, often delight in unleashing strange scientific devices on an unsuspecting populace (or Scion). Scions who turn their prodigious intellect to the construction of curiosities often try to find ways to make useful tools, entertaining toys or devious traps. All three are possible for the mind capable of taking an idea from concept to execution. With Epic Intelligence and the Craft and Science Abilities, a Scion can manufacture a wide range of items, but this Knack enables the Scion to build uncanny devices that defy conventional reason or function. Gadgets created by Scions have three primary possible functions:\n\n\n* Replace another item\u2019s function: For instance, creating a quick repair for a broken carburetor, using an aluminum can and a bicycle tube. Such a fix can temporarily restore function to a \u201cmundane\u201d (non-magical) item, such as a car, a computer or an orbital shuttle.\n\n\n* Temporarily replace a Relic: The Scion can use his innate knowledge of design and creation to make an object that can substitute for a missing or damaged Relic. The replacement allows its wielder to access one Purview that the original missing or damaged Relic normally provided. Replacement Relics require the creating Scion to imbue the item with a bit of ichor as power, which means suffering a level of lethal damage (with no soak) in order to bleed out some ichor to fuel the item.\n\n\n* Perform a specialized new function: The Scion creates a device with functions not found among the more \u201ccommon\u201d tools of the World. The Golden Servant of Hephaestus (Scion: Demigod, pp. 228-229) would be an example of this.\n\n\n",
                "As a general principle, items that replace another item\u2019s function or temporarily replace a Relic are temporary. The Scion\u2019s player spends five points of Legend and rolls (Intelligence + Craft + Legend). The difficulty depends upon the object, as shown in the accompanying table. This is an extended task of the Miscellaneous type, so it can be done in the midst of combat as the Scion theorizes, tears apart available materials and comes up with a solution on the fly. The temporary component functions for one use or (if the crafting Scion\u2019s player spends a point of Willpower) for the rest of the scene.<br/><table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item is larger than a breadbox or smaller than a car key</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item is larger than a person or smaller than a thumbtack</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item is larger than a car or smaller than a grain of rice</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item is larger than a battleship or microscopic</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complexity</td>\n<td>Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item has many moving parts</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item has many intricate moving parts</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item uses electricity</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item uses micro-circuitry</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dramatic Relation</td>\n<td>Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item has only a peripheral relation to the story</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item has no relation to the story</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Item runs counter to part of story, theme or plot</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n</table>",
                "Specialized new items rely on the Scion exploiting (or writing) new scientific principles. Creation of such devices can take months or years of time; the extended test uses (Intelligence + Science + Legend) to theorize the item, then (Intelligence + Craft + Legend) to build it. The difficulty for such a task typically begins at 35 and can increase due to object size and complexity (as well as how relevant it is to the story at hand; see the sidebar for some suggestions). If the item performs some otherwise impossible task or would radically change day-to-day life for the common man \u2014 cheap, clean fusion power, flying cars starting at $100, an algorithm that proves that P = NP \u2014 the base difficulty ranges from 50 to 100, and the task can only be completed by a God. Thanks to the interference of Fate, any object that would completely hamstring a dramatic moment or reshape the cosmic order is simply beyond the magnitude of capabilities for even a God with this Knack. Also, the Scion must have some sort of tools or materials to work with. Trapped in the Mojave, the Scion can\u2019t make a moisture condenser out of sand, but in a junkyard, the Scion could construct a miniature tank.",
