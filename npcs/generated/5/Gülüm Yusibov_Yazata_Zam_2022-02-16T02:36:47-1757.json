Internal Refinery expands that latter protection to not only poisons or toxins she eats, but all poisons and toxins she\u2019s exposed to, as well as any diseases that mortal flesh might suffer. In addition, a character with this Knack can refine any poison, toxin or disease to which she is exposed into a single dose of an antidote for that substance or cure to that affliction. If the character spits this antidote or cure out and administers it to an afflicted patient, it completely erases one dose or one exposure to the hazardous substance in the patient\u2019s system. The character must administer this treatment within one scene of the patient\u2019s exposure, and within one action of when she (the character with this Knack) refines the substance into a dose of its cure.
