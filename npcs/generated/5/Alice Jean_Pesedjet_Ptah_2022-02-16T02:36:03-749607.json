She might not be a master of any single subject, but she knows a little bit about a wide range of disparate, esoteric subjects. (She could explain the intricacies of the Teapot Dome Scandal in terms of the interpersonal dynamics of the Justice League, then explain why typing \u201cwhile one fork\u201d into a UNIX system is a bad idea, before wrapping up with an explanation of how a Venus\u2019s-\ufb02ytrap works.) Normally, the burden of portraying this Knack falls to the player, so it behooves her to keep an ear to the ground for obscure trivia she can work into her character\u2019s dialogue during the game. The Storyteller shares a bit of that burden as well, though. During a scene in which the characters seem to be stumped or hopelessly out of options, the Storyteller should \u201cremind\u201d the player of some pertinent bit of obscure trivia her character knows that bears a direct, helpful relevance to the problem at hand. It behooves the Storyteller, then, to make a list of a handful of such helpful hints when he\u2019s designing his story. Just in case.",

The weapon can be of any shape and size, but the distinction is largely a matter of personal taste, rather than available traits. These weapons do not use the normal traits from the chart in Scion: Hero. Instead, when the character removes the weapon from the fire, the player receives a base number of points equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend for each weapon. These points can add to a base Accuracy +0, Damage +0 and Defense -1, and they can subtract from a starting Speed 6 (reducing it to a minimum of 1). The player assigns the weapon\u2019s traits as the character produces the weapon, and he can\u2019t change them afterward."

The fiery rounds also inflict lethal damage, even against creatures that normally take bashing damage from bullets, such as the walking dead.
