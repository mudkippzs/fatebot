                "The Scion\u2019s body is so tough that, even unarmed, he can parry close-combat attacks that would in\ufb02ict lethal damage. If a berserker hopped up on Jotunblut or a thrall full of eitr tries to split the Scion\u2019s skull with a \ufb01 re ax, the Scion can take the blow on his forearm and knock it aside without serious injury. (That assumes the character\u2019s Parry DV is suf\ufb01cient to cancel out the attack roll\u2019s successes, of course.) While that bene\ufb01t remains in effect all the time, the Scion can also engage a temporary one that offers even more protection. With the expenditure of a Legend point, a measure of the Scion\u2019s ichor wells up from within and coats the Scion\u2019s body. This coating hardens into a gleaming, metallic armor that\u2019s no thicker than a hair\u2019s breadth. This armor has a bashing and lethal soak equal to the character\u2019s Legend, and it in\ufb02icts a mobility penalty of only -1. The ichor coating is thin enough to \ufb01 t comfortably beneath one\u2019s clothing, so it adds its protective value to that of any other armor the character might already be wearing. Natural armor from this Knack lasts for only one scene and disintegrates at the scene\u2019s end.",

The Scion must spend at least a minute lecturing to a crowd on a particular topic. The Scion\u2019s player then spends two points of Legend and rolls (Charisma + Presence + Legend). For each success scored, one person in the crowd gains temporary use of a Scion\u2019s Ability score. The Scion can perform this quick instruction for any one Ability, but everyone in the crowd hears the same speech and therefore can potentially benefit from the same Ability. For the rest of the scene, those affected by this power may choose to use the Scion\u2019s Ability in place of their own. Heroes can only allow a beneficiary to gain a maximum of three temporary dots in an Ability this way. Demigods can grant up to four dots, while Gods can grant up to five. Such a trick is very useful for turning a disorganized mob into deadly streetfighters (Brawl), creating a temporary squad of EMTs to deal with a disaster (Medicine) or getting the help of a group of inexperienced people in a large construction project, like the pyramids (Craft). Using this Knack does not in any way lower or use up the invoking Scion\u2019s own Ability. The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene.",

Any pestilence or poison lurking in what he consumes burns in the \ufb01res of his superior constitution, without even requiring a Fortitude roll. The same goes for drugs or poisons he ingests on purpose, or for any Mickey Finn a ne\u2019er-do-well might try to slip him.

A charmed person can still think clearly, question one\u2019s motives and turn someone down if something about what she\u2019s saying doesn\u2019t feel quite right. Not so the person affected by this Knack. The character who uses it spends one Legend point as his player rolls (Charisma + Presence + Legend). The victim\u2019s player contests this effect with a (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll. If the victim\u2019s roll fails to garner the necessary successes, the victim falls madly, unquestioningly in love with the user of the Knack for a number of days equal to the user\u2019s threshold successes. The victim is blindly enthralled and will do anything in her power to please the object of her affection. This Knack works regardless of the relative Legend disparity between the user and his victim.
