This Knack comes in handy in the ballroom, the bedroom, even the thick of battle. The first two applications might not come up as often in play, but they shouldn\u2019t be discounted out of hand. The dance performance of two characters with this Knack would put the best work of Fred Astair and Ginger Rogers to shame. The sexual prowess of a character with this Knack would be legendary all on its own. The third application of this Knack makes coordinating assaults (see Scion: Hero, p. 190) that much easier. Using it, a character can attach herself to any coordinated assault she sees fit, without the player of the person coordinating the assault having to include the character in the dice roll to do so. If the character with this Knack wants to coordinate her attack with only one other person, neither of them even has to make a roll to do so. As long as they act at the same time and attack the same target, they are coordinated by default.",

With her excellent command of the battle situation and her prepared contingency plans, she\u2019s able to react by using a previously-developed script instead of falling back on reflexes.

This assessment comes across in terms of how the foe\u2019s combat abilities compare to the Scion\u2019s own. He gets a sense of whether the foe has more or fewer dots of Physical Attributes (Epic and otherwise) than he does. The same goes for their relative number of dots in Brawl, Marksmanship, Melee and Thrown, as well as their relative Join Battle dice pools and their soak totals. Also, if some power or special quality renders the foe especially vulnerable or completely invulnerable to something to which the Scion has ready access, the Scion gets a sense of that as well. What the Scion decides to do with this information is up to him. This information occurs re\ufb02exively to the Scion who uses the Knack, and he may assess as many foes automatically as he spends points of Legend.",

As such, the player can apply the character\u2019s Epic Intelligence bonus dice to any Intelligence-based roll required to glean information, regardless of whether the character has any dots in the Ability in question. For instance, identifying what martial arts style someone is using would require an (Intelligence + Brawl) roll. With this Knack, a character with no dots in Brawl could handily identify the style, the particular variant of it the student is using and who the student\u2019s teacher most likely was.

Where this Knack truly surpasses its prerequisite is that it allows the character to read any written language with which he isn\u2019t familiar, even if it\u2019s written in characters that are completely alien to him.

As such, he can apply some of his appropriate Epic Attribute bonus to the appropriate roll, despite the fact that he has no dots in the relevant Ability. In such a circumstance, a player can enhance a roll with this Knack and add a number of bonus successes from his character\u2019s Epic Attribute equal to the number of dots he has in the Epic Attribute.
