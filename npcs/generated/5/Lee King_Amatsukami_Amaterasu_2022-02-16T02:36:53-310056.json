The Scion must spend at least a minute lecturing to a crowd on a particular topic. The Scion\u2019s player then spends two points of Legend and rolls (Charisma + Presence + Legend). For each success scored, one person in the crowd gains temporary use of a Scion\u2019s Ability score. The Scion can perform this quick instruction for any one Ability, but everyone in the crowd hears the same speech and therefore can potentially benefit from the same Ability. For the rest of the scene, those affected by this power may choose to use the Scion\u2019s Ability in place of their own. Heroes can only allow a beneficiary to gain a maximum of three temporary dots in an Ability this way. Demigods can grant up to four dots, while Gods can grant up to five. Such a trick is very useful for turning a disorganized mob into deadly streetfighters (Brawl), creating a temporary squad of EMTs to deal with a disaster (Medicine) or getting the help of a group of inexperienced people in a large construction project, like the pyramids (Craft). Using this Knack does not in any way lower or use up the invoking Scion\u2019s own Ability. The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene.",

Thrown weapons or other thrown items that would normally cause bashing damage (a coconut, for example) in\ufb02ict lethal damage and take on the Piercing quality instead when the Scion uses Mighty Heave.

Spending a point of Legend and a point of Willpower, the Scion burns a mental vision of himself so deeply into the victim\u2019s mind that everyone the victim sees thereafter who\u2019s of the same sex as the Scion seems to be wearing the Scion\u2019s face. This effect is especially jarring because other features such as height, weight, hairstyle, skin tone and whatnot don\u2019t change from what\u2019s natural for the person the victim is actually seeing. Only the Scion\u2019s face stands out, sized and colored as appropriate for the person on hand, yet still undeniably the Scion\u2019s own. Shaking off this disorienting hallucination costs the victim a point of Willpower, but that doesn\u2019t end the effect. An hour later, the effect creeps back up on the victim until every person of the appropriate gender has the Scion\u2019s face again. Even worse, a character cannot regain spent Willpower points while he\u2019s languishing under this effect. The only hope for a mortal victim is that the Scion will track him down and decide to end the effect. The demigod can do the same for Scion victims as well, but in the children of the Gods, the effect will wear off on its own after the victim has spent 24 hours with no points of Willpower.",

This Knack works equally well whether the Scion\u2019s Epic Appearance involves beauty or its opposite. Characters of lesser Legend are unable to break the Scion\u2019s gaze on their own, but those with an equal or greater Legend are not so vulnerable.
