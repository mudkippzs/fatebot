She can\u2019t sense an illusion and pull information from nowhere about its creator (that requires the Mystery Purview), but she could sense, \u201cThis is one of Loki\u2019s tricks,\u201d if the Lie-Smith had fooled her before. The one exception to the use of this Knack is trying to see through illusions and supernatural deceptions created by beings with either Ultimate Manipulation or the avatar expression of the Illusion Purview. The abilities of these divine tricksters transcend normal means of detection. A God who employs Ultimate Perception, however, has a chance to see through such illusions anyway.

                "After running into ambushes featuring no less than two dozen animated sand-golems with stone hearts, a Scion begins to wonder if there\u2019s some sort of pattern behind the attacks. The logical mind of a Scion with Epic Intelligence puts those patterns together and determines some viable conclusion. Once the sand-golems have been defeated, for instance, the Scion might theorize that since they are all made from sand, their creator must reside somewhere with a surfeit of sand \u2014 some desert. Normal people create theories like this all the time, but Scions with this Knack create theories that are correct. The Scion\u2019s player spends three points of Legend and rolls (Intelligence + appropriate Ability + Legend). The Ability used will depend upon the axiom in question: Deriving a scientific fact about something uses Science, while relying on observed clues to deduce a suspect uses Investigation. The Scion must then state the axiom clearly, such as \u201cI deduce from the presence of so much sand in these golems that the creator must reside within a desert,\u201d or \u201cThe constant attacks by ninja imply that our enemy must be related somehow to the Amatsukami.\u201d If the player\u2019s roll succeeds, the Storyteller will respond with \u201ctrue,\u201d meaning that the Scion\u2019s claim is known to be true; \u201cfalse,\u201d meaning that the claim is known to be false; or \u201cincorrect,\u201d meaning that the Scion has proceeded from a false assumption (perhaps forgetting that the ambushing ninja were all clones of Jean-Claude van Damme). If the Storyteller had already planned out that element of the adventure, then the player learns what the Storyteller had in mind by virtue of the power; if the Storyteller had left the element undecided, then his answer to the player\u2019s Axiom essentially enforces how that part of the story will unfold. The Scion logically knows exactly what to expect, and she knows immediately if her best guess is right, wrong, or founded on a mistake that she made. The difficulty of the roll depends upon the scope of the statement. Nailing down a simple fact, such as \u201cAll of these attackers use cheap guns, so their boss must be poor,\u201d has a low difficulty (1-5). Nailing down a more wide-ranging fact, such as \u201cDespite their varied forms, all of these titanspawn are all susceptible to silver, so we should prepare to use the powers of the Moon against them,\u201d has a moderate difficulty (6-15). Facts that affect the Overworld or Underworld, or that nail down specifics with exacting detail, are severely difficult (25+). The difference between a normal deduction and a fact nailed down with Axiom is that the Scion\u2019s stated fact (if confirmed by the Storyteller) is known to be right. Essentially, the Scion\u2019s player states something that will be true or will be false about the rest of the story. The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene.",

Also, if enemies are lying in ambush in the nearby area and are not concealed by supernatural means, it is impossible for their surprise attack to catch the Scion unaware.
