                "Prerequisite Knack: Body Armor (Scion: Demigod, pp. 57-58) By concentrating all of his phenomenal stamina on a single point of his body, the Scion can make a tiny area nigh-invulnerable. For a second, the Scion\u2019s ichor seeps into that small point no larger than a fingernail, and that part of the Scion\u2019s body becomes tremendously difficult to damage. The area affected gains a Hardness rating (see Scion: Hero, p. 201) equal to the Scion\u2019s Epic Stamina. Any attack with fewer damage dice than the Hardness rating simply bounces off with no effect, while an attack with more damage dice loses a number of dice equal to the Hardness rating before the Scion attempts to soak it (as a special extension of Hardness, which normally only applies to inanimate objects). The real trick lies in positioning this tiny, invulnerable spot to absorb an attack. Normally, a Scion uses his Parry DV to defect attacks in this fashion. Since the Scion has the Body Armor Knack as a prerequisite, he can already Parry melee attacks. Instead, Invulnerable Nail provides the Scion with a defense against an attack that he can see coming but can\u2019t parry, such as when he\u2019s held in place by a titanspawn\u2019s tentacle and needs to make his forehead momentarily impenetrable to the oncoming needle- tipped appendage that will try to suck out his brain. In such a case, the Scion keeps his full unarmed Parry DV because he can try to defect the attack at the last moment by anticipating where it will strike and fortifying that part of his body. Similarly, a clever Scion might feign suicide by attacking himself with a mundane weapon and defecting it at the last minute through the use of this Knack. Activating this Knack costs two points of Legend. It is a reflexive action done in response to an attack.",

By spending a point of Willpower and Legend, the Scion cools the crowd\u2019s urge for instant action and buys himself enough time to try to talk some sense into everyone. Doing so is primarily a matter of role-playing, but if the player is not as good an extemporaneous speech-maker as his character is, he may roll (Charisma + Presence) to simulate his heartfelt call for calm. His words convince three members of the mob per success on the roll. This effect lasts for the scene, after which the mob either disperses or renews its shenanigans with its original vigor. If the character is attempting to halt the depredations of a mob that is being controlled or directed supernaturally, use of this Knack constitutes an opposed roll against the other power\u2019s activation roll.

Only solid, incontrovertible proof showing that what the Scion said was undeniably false will convince the mark he\u2019s been fooled. Even then, who ever is showing him the proof will have to convince him that the proof is genuine and not some clever forgery. A Scion with this Knack doesn\u2019t have to lie when she uses it.

Attempting to hypnotize a fellow Scion of lesser or equal (Willpower + Legend) requires not only a Willpower expenditure but a (Manipulation + Command + Legend) roll contested against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). Scions cannot instantly hypnotize fellow Scions of higher (Willpower + Legend). Should he successfully hypnotize a victim, the Scion can implant one hidden command that the victim must obey at the time of the Scion\u2019s choosing. The command must be something that the victim can accomplish in one scene, and the trigger condition that compels him to attempt it must occur within a number of months equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend. The Scion can give as speci\ufb01c an order as he pleases, and a mortal cannot interpret it in any way other than the spirit in which it was intended. A fellow Scion can interpret it loosely to his own advantage, as per Overt Order, but doing so costs him a point of Willpower. The victim remains unaware of the ticking time bomb in his subconscious, but he does have a chance to resist it when the trigger condition occurs. At the moment when he has been commanded to perform the action in question, the victim\u2019s player may make a (Wits + Integrity) roll.
