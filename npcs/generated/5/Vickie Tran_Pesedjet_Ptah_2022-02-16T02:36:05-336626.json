                "The Scion is widely read and has a ridiculously well-rounded education. She might not be a master of any single subject, but she knows a little bit about a wide range of disparate, esoteric subjects. (She could explain the intricacies of the Teapot Dome Scandal in terms of the interpersonal dynamics of the Justice League, then explain why typing \u201cwhile one fork\u201d into a UNIX system is a bad idea, before wrapping up with an explanation of how a Venus\u2019s-\ufb02ytrap works.) Normally, the burden of portraying this Knack falls to the player, so it behooves her to keep an ear to the ground for obscure trivia she can work into her character\u2019s dialogue during the game. The Storyteller shares a bit of that burden as well, though. During a scene in which the characters seem to be stumped or hopelessly out of options, the Storyteller should \u201cremind\u201d the player of some pertinent bit of obscure trivia her character knows that bears a direct, helpful relevance to the problem at hand. It behooves the Storyteller, then, to make a list of a handful of such helpful hints when he\u2019s designing his story. Just in case.",

For instance, say a Scion with this Knack whose native language is English has picked up French at Orly Airport in Paris and would like to leave a thank-you note for a bartender who gave him helpful information. That Scion might write, \u201cMare- see du mah-vay zayday,\u201d to express his thanks, when what he really means is, \u201cMerci de m\u2019avez aid\u00e9.\u201d Likewise, reading the new language can be dif\ufb01cult if that language uses characters that don\u2019t appear in an alphabet with which he is already familiar.",

                "After running into ambushes featuring no less than two dozen animated sand-golems with stone hearts, a Scion begins to wonder if there\u2019s some sort of pattern behind the attacks. The logical mind of a Scion with Epic Intelligence puts those patterns together and determines some viable conclusion. Once the sand-golems have been defeated, for instance, the Scion might theorize that since they are all made from sand, their creator must reside somewhere with a surfeit of sand \u2014 some desert. Normal people create theories like this all the time, but Scions with this Knack create theories that are correct. The Scion\u2019s player spends three points of Legend and rolls (Intelligence + appropriate Ability + Legend). The Ability used will depend upon the axiom in question: Deriving a scientific fact about something uses Science, while relying on observed clues to deduce a suspect uses Investigation. The Scion must then state the axiom clearly, such as \u201cI deduce from the presence of so much sand in these golems that the creator must reside within a desert,\u201d or \u201cThe constant attacks by ninja imply that our enemy must be related somehow to the Amatsukami.\u201d If the player\u2019s roll succeeds, the Storyteller will respond with \u201ctrue,\u201d meaning that the Scion\u2019s claim is known to be true; \u201cfalse,\u201d meaning that the claim is known to be false; or \u201cincorrect,\u201d meaning that the Scion has proceeded from a false assumption (perhaps forgetting that the ambushing ninja were all clones of Jean-Claude van Damme). If the Storyteller had already planned out that element of the adventure, then the player learns what the Storyteller had in mind by virtue of the power; if the Storyteller had left the element undecided, then his answer to the player\u2019s Axiom essentially enforces how that part of the story will unfold. The Scion logically knows exactly what to expect, and she knows immediately if her best guess is right, wrong, or founded on a mistake that she made. The difficulty of the roll depends upon the scope of the statement. Nailing down a simple fact, such as \u201cAll of these attackers use cheap guns, so their boss must be poor,\u201d has a low difficulty (1-5). Nailing down a more wide-ranging fact, such as \u201cDespite their varied forms, all of these titanspawn are all susceptible to silver, so we should prepare to use the powers of the Moon against them,\u201d has a moderate difficulty (6-15). Facts that affect the Overworld or Underworld, or that nail down specifics with exacting detail, are severely difficult (25+). The difference between a normal deduction and a fact nailed down with Axiom is that the Scion\u2019s stated fact (if confirmed by the Storyteller) is known to be right. Essentially, the Scion\u2019s player states something that will be true or will be false about the rest of the story. The Scion can use this Knack only once per scene.",
