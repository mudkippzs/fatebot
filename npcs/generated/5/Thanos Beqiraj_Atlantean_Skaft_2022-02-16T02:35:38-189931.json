She might not be a master of any single subject, but she knows a little bit about a wide range of disparate, esoteric subjects. (She could explain the intricacies of the Teapot Dome Scandal in terms of the interpersonal dynamics of the Justice League, then explain why typing \u201cwhile one fork\u201d into a UNIX system is a bad idea, before wrapping up with an explanation of how a Venus\u2019s-\ufb02ytrap works.) Normally, the burden of portraying this Knack falls to the player, so it behooves her to keep an ear to the ground for obscure trivia she can work into her character\u2019s dialogue during the game. The Storyteller shares a bit of that burden as well, though. During a scene in which the characters seem to be stumped or hopelessly out of options, the Storyteller should \u201cremind\u201d the player of some pertinent bit of obscure trivia her character knows that bears a direct, helpful relevance to the problem at hand. It behooves the Storyteller, then, to make a list of a handful of such helpful hints when he\u2019s designing his story. Just in case.",

The best makeup and disguise means nothing if the imposter can\u2019t react to life\u2019s little surprises exactly as the subject of his mimicry would react. With this Knack, however, the Scion can discern with preternatural quickness how the people who think he\u2019s someone else expect that someone else to react. Their minute changes of expression or body language give their expectations away, allowing the imposter to react accordingly. For the most part, this Knack plays itself out without resorting to dice rolls or trait comparisons. As the imposter\u2019s player roleplays (and the imposter himself does so also), the Storyteller simply informs him of what the unsuspecting characters\u2019 expectations are, and the player chooses his imposter\u2019s reactions accordingly. This Knack does not provide a supernatural disguise that would fool someone with the Unfailing Recognition Knack (from Scion: Hero, p. 134), but even if such a Scion can see through the imposter\u2019s disguise, his recognition alone would not be enough to convince anyone else. The imposter retains the wherewithal to stand up to any impromptu interrogation and maintain his charade in everyone else\u2019s eyes, thus making the only other Scion who knows the imposter\u2019s true identity look like a horse\u2019s ass or a liar.",

Writing the language is a bit trickier, as he can only transliterate his written words in the alphabet of his native language until someone teaches him the alphabet and punctuation of the new language. For instance, say a Scion with this Knack whose native language is English has picked up French at Orly Airport in Paris and would like to leave a thank-you note for a bartender who gave him helpful information. That Scion might write, \u201cMare- see du mah-vay zayday,\u201d to express his thanks, when what he really means is, \u201cMerci de m\u2019avez aid\u00e9.\u201d Likewise, reading the new language can be dif\ufb01cult if that language uses characters that don\u2019t appear in an alphabet with which he is already familiar.",

While some Scions get around this by developing enough Epic Stamina to no longer need sleep, other Scions prefer a different approach \u2014 one that also has the advantage of working while unconscious, regardless of whether it\u2019s sleep-induced or trauma-induced. As the Scion slips into a comatose state, she leaves a bit of her mind attuned to her godly senses, and her subconscious mind remains aware of what goes on around her while she is out cold. With In Your Dreams, the Scion generally doesn\u2019t see anything (since most people don\u2019t sleep with their eyes open), but she retains everything that she hears, feels, tastes and smells while asleep. When she awakens, she can access her memories of all that happened around her, just as if she had been lying there feigning slumber. This is greatly enhanced if she also has the Perfect Memory Epic Intelligence Knack (Scion: Hero, pp. 135-136). Activating this Knack costs one point of Legend. Its effects last as long as the Scion remains asleep or unconscious. The player can activate this Knack as a reflexive action if some power or injury renders the Scion comatose.",

Its Hardness decreases to half normal, and if the object is a precision item (like a gun), it has a 50% chance to malfunction any time it\u2019s used. Restoring a rusted item to its original state wipes away all traces of age and even reverses the effects, so that a wholly rusted-out car body (for instance) would be as good as new. The rusted parts don\u2019t just disappear, they reverse the process and become solid metal again.
