Mortals and Scions who hear it are so inspired that their spent Willpower points are entirely re\ufb01lled. This Knack also has a more insidious dimension. If the Scion \ufb01nds himself in charge of a group of titanspawn, he can spend a point of Willpower and give those awful minions a speech that empowers them just as Inspirational Figure inspires mortals. Each titanspawn who hears him regains a point of spent Willpower.

A rusted metal object loses durability and functionality. Its Hardness decreases to half normal, and if the object is a precision item (like a gun), it has a 50% chance to malfunction any time it\u2019s used. Restoring a rusted item to its original state wipes away all traces of age and even reverses the effects, so that a wholly rusted-out car body (for instance) would be as good as new. The rusted parts don\u2019t just disappear, they reverse the process and become solid metal again. Invoking this power on an item requires the Scion to physically touch or manipulate the object, and it has no effect on metals that don\u2019t rust (such as gold) or upon Relics."
