                "A Scion with this Knack possesses a truly superhuman sense of strategy. He anticipates an enemy\u2019s evasions, counter-strategies and gambits with ease. He can reason around a berserker\u2019s shock and awe or calculate a dodging foe\u2019s final location to slip past that foe\u2019s defenses. He can find just the right angle to slip from an opponent\u2019s grasp, and he can see through feints and other ploys with ease. The Scion activates this Knack by selecting an opponent and spending one point of Legend. For the rest of the scene, he counteracts the automatic successes, bonus dice and similar benefits conferred by other Knacks and Boons. The total number of such bonuses counteracted cannot exceed the Scion\u2019s automatic success from Epic Intelligence. This Knack can negate bonuses from Knacks and Boons, as well as automatic successes and bonuses from Epic Attributes themselves. It does not affect stunt bonuses or extra dice from invoking Virtues. If an opponent receives more bonuses than a Scion can counteract, the user of this Knack picks what he will negate. This Knack might seem an odd one to include in a book about the Norse and their Gods. In truth, despite their famed fury and aggression, Norse warriors valued a cunning fighter at least as much as a frenzied powerhouse.",
