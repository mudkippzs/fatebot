            "Dice Pool: Intelligence + Animal Ken \nCost: (1 Willpower + 3 Legend) per Attribute; (1 Willpower + 5 Legend) per Epic Attribute \nBy force of will, the character can make an animal simply better than it could ever become on its own. Not only can he make an animal bigger, stronger and tougher, he can also make it faster, more beautiful, more charming or wiser. For one Willpower and three Legend points, he can increase any of the beast\u2019s Mental or Social Attributes by one dot. He can also increase its Dexterity by one dot for the same cost. This Boon can no more than double the beast\u2019s original Dexterity. Increases to its Mental and Social Attributes are limited to the human maximum of five dots."

For the rest of the scene, the Scion controls the animal\u2019s body just as a character with Horse (Cheval \u2022\u2022\u2022) can control a human\u2019s body. This Boon functions exactly as that one does, with the same limitations and effects on the Scion\u2019s body. The only difference is that Horse applies to possession of a human\u2019s body, while Ride Animal applies to specimens of the Scion\u2019s chosen animal or to his Birthright creature."

With this Boon, however, the Scion doesn\u2019t render himself harder to see, he becomes that much harder to hit. The parts of his body that Phase Cloak would make invisible become intangible instead. A character can attempt to use this Boon only once per scene, and the effects last for the entire scene.

Such animals are as loyal to him as those granted by the Creatures Birthright, and he can automatically command them mentally. They follow any command the Scion gives them to the best of their ability, and they last for one scene before dissolving into nothingness once again.

A Scion might take on a snake\u2019s sinuous grace (Dexterity), a peacock\u2019s beauty (Appearance), an elephant\u2019s proverbial memory (via Intelligence) or any other justifiable characteristic.

If his animal is a spider or gecko, he can change the surfaces of his hands and feet to enable himself to climb on walls. If his animal is a bird or bat or airborne insect, he can transform his arms into wings that allow him to fly at a rate equal to his Move rate.
