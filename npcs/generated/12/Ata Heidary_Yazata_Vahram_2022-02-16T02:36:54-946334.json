                "Prerequisite Knack: Body Armor (Scion: Demigod, pp. 57-58) By concentrating all of his phenomenal stamina on a single point of his body, the Scion can make a tiny area nigh-invulnerable. For a second, the Scion\u2019s ichor seeps into that small point no larger than a fingernail, and that part of the Scion\u2019s body becomes tremendously difficult to damage. The area affected gains a Hardness rating (see Scion: Hero, p. 201) equal to the Scion\u2019s Epic Stamina. Any attack with fewer damage dice than the Hardness rating simply bounces off with no effect, while an attack with more damage dice loses a number of dice equal to the Hardness rating before the Scion attempts to soak it (as a special extension of Hardness, which normally only applies to inanimate objects). The real trick lies in positioning this tiny, invulnerable spot to absorb an attack. Normally, a Scion uses his Parry DV to defect attacks in this fashion. Since the Scion has the Body Armor Knack as a prerequisite, he can already Parry melee attacks. Instead, Invulnerable Nail provides the Scion with a defense against an attack that he can see coming but can\u2019t parry, such as when he\u2019s held in place by a titanspawn\u2019s tentacle and needs to make his forehead momentarily impenetrable to the oncoming needle- tipped appendage that will try to suck out his brain. In such a case, the Scion keeps his full unarmed Parry DV because he can try to defect the attack at the last moment by anticipating where it will strike and fortifying that part of his body. Similarly, a clever Scion might feign suicide by attacking himself with a mundane weapon and defecting it at the last minute through the use of this Knack. Activating this Knack costs two points of Legend. It is a reflexive action done in response to an attack.",

For the cost of 10 Legend points, this Knack converts the distance increment a character can jump from yards to hundreds of yards. That is, the character can leap the distance of one football field straight up for every dot of (Strength + Athletics) she has plus the bonus number granted by her Epic Strength. She can jump twice that length horizontally. At Strength 12, Athletics 5 and Epic Strength 10 (plus accounting for this Knack\u2019s prerequisite), the character can leap a little bit more than seven miles straight up \u2014 which is about one and a half miles higher than the peak of Mount Everest \u2014 or more than 14 miles horizontally. Used in combat, this Knack makes jumping something more than a Speed 5 miscellaneous action. When a character takes a leap that can potentially carry her for miles, that action is typically narrated rather than played out tick by tick. If no one can fly after her, leap after her or run fast enough to keep up with her, the character effectively leaves combat. In \u201cflight,\u201d the character retains her full DVs and attack dice pools. This Knack also makes jumping more dangerous than it normally is. Normally, a character can always safely fall from the maximum height to which she can normally jump. This Knack, however, overrides that safety standard by extending a person\u2019s jumping height to preposterous extremes. If a character who uses this Knack to leap aeronautically is successfully attacked in flight and that attack inflicts enough damage to cause knockdown or knockback, the character\u2019s prodigious leap turns into an uncontrolled fall. The player gets one chance per dot of Epic Strength the character has to succeed on a (Dexterity + Athletics) roll. If she does succeed, the character retains her aerial poise and lands, if not gracefully, at least safely. If the roll fails, the character suffers damage relevant to falling from a great height.",

Scions who engage in this practice learn to absorb the capabilities of an animal by devouring such a creature and drawing forth its essence from the digested flesh. The Scion must eat a piece of meat from the appropriate animal (a potentially risky act, considering that the animal is probably considered sacred to his patron God). Then, the player expends the Willpower and Legend and rolls (Stamina + Animal Ken). The successes scored indicate the number of points of Abilities that the Scion may borrow from the animal. A Scion can only borrow Abilities up to the level possessed by the animal, although these dots can add on to his existing skill dots to a maximum total of five. Skills gained with Faunaphagia remain for the rest of the scene."

            "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 1+ Legend \nUpon purchasing this Boon, the Scion chooses one of the three attribute categories (Mental, Social or Physical) to associate with this power. Thereafter, the Scion can invoke the principle of Humata (Good Thoughts) and call upon greater reserves of power. The Scion gains a single \u201cWild Card\u201d dot of Epic Attributes, which she may apply to any Attribute within her chosen category. This may raise an Epic Attribute beyond what the character\u2019s Legend rating allows. The character cannot use Humata multiple times to increase an Epic Attribute by more than one, or to increase any other Epic Attributes. Nor does the temporary dot of Epic Attribute grant an additional Knack. Humata (and its successor Boons) cannot raise an Epic Attribute above 10 dots. \nInvoking Humata costs as many Legend points as the final value of the chosen Epic Attibute. The effect lasts for a scene, and cannot be changed until the scene ends. \n Example: A Scion of Anahita has an Epic Intelligence of 2, no Epic Wits, a Legend of 3 and Humata associated with Mental Attributes. She could spends 3 points of Legend and increases her Epic Intelligence to 3, ignoring that her Legend is too low for that rating; or, she could spend 1 Legend to gain one dot of Epic Wits for the rest of the scene."
