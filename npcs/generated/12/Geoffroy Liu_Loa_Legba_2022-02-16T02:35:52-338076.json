Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool. He must claim the God\u2019s authority when he does so, speaking in the divine figure\u2019s holy name. Characters with this Knack can use it on any willing emissary of equal or lesser Legend. (As the messenger of the Dodekatheon, for instance, Hermes has been a frequent recipient of this effect.) Its remote effect works on a single listener or on a whole group of people. Also, the character\u2019s instructions to her emissary cannot run counter to the effect of the Charisma-based roll she intends to bestow upon that emissary. She cannot, for instance, prepare what looks like a stirring battlefield address on paper but is actually intended to demoralize the troops through whom her chosen generals speaks.",

To use this Boon, the Scion must have a picture of her victim, some genetic token of the victim\u2019s (such as a lock of hair or several drops of blood) or something the victim created (from a printed-out email to an ice sculpture). By meditating on the item and relaxing her own perceptions\u2014as well as spending a point of Legend after a successful (Perception + Empathy) roll on the part of her player\u2014the Scion experiences the victim\u2019s perceptions clearly and distinctly. The victim is unaware of the Scion\u2019s attention, but the Scion remains semi-aware of her own surroundings."

If the Scion victim has an equal number of Legend dots, the Voodoo Scion\u2019s player must also succeed in a contested roll of her (Intelligence + Control) against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend)."

Younger Loa cannot gain sufficient control over these inimical beings to exert their Cheval Boons through them.
