Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool.

If the Scion spends one additional Legend point per person, each person suffers an additional Virtue Extremity. That is, if he wants to affect five people with one Virtue Extremity, he must spend only five Legend points. If he wants them to suffer two Virtue Extremities, he must spend 10 Legend points. If he wants to affect all five people with the Virtue Extremity from all four of his Virtues, he must spend 20 Legend points. The Scion can choose how many of the present targets he wishes to affect, but he must affect them all with the same number of Virtue Extremities."

Only peer pressure or the subtle jabs of Fate can make him actually act on that responsibility if he doesn\u2019t want to, but not every Loa needs that sort of prodding. If chooses to, he can take a special interest in a mortal and make her his own. Thereafter, anyone who wants to use Cheval Boons on that mortal must go through her met tet first."
