Once a Scion chooses this Knack, she can shift her Epic Appearance from hideous to beautiful at will. The player simply expends the requisite Legend cost and the Scion\u2019s mien transforms. In either form, she is still recognizable as herself; she cannot use this Knack to change her appearance, unless she also has a Knack like Detail Variation from p. 71 of Scion: God. However, she can change from an elegant, refined woman to a vengeful, nerve-wracking hag in the blink of an eye. Once she transforms thus, her range of available Epic Appearance Knacks shifts as appropriate. While beautiful, then, the Scion can invoke all of her known Epic Appearance Knacks that rely on great beauty; while hideous, she can invoke any of her Epic Appearance Knacks that require a monstrous countenance. Once a Scion learns this Knack, she can freely purchase any Epic Appearance Knack that would normally require incredible beauty or incredible monstrosity. She can only use the Knacks appropriate to the form that she currently bears, though. Activating this Knack costs three points of Legend. The Scion remains in her switched state until she decides to activate the Knack again.

With In Your Dreams, the Scion generally doesn\u2019t see anything (since most people don\u2019t sleep with their eyes open), but she retains everything that she hears, feels, tastes and smells while asleep. When she awakens, she can access her memories of all that happened around her, just as if she had been lying there feigning slumber. This is greatly enhanced if she also has the Perfect Memory Epic Intelligence Knack (Scion: Hero, pp. 135-136). Activating this Knack costs one point of Legend.

If the attacker scores more successes than the Scion\u2019s player, his character\u2019s actions proceed as normal.

For example, if the Scion\u2019s player scores 6 successes on the (Appearance + Presence + Legend) roll and an attacker only manages to eke out 3 successes on his (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll, then the Scion gains a +3 bonus to DV against that attacker for the rest of the scene. This benefit applies against everyone who tries to take action against the Scion for the rest of the scene, though each attacker makes a separate resistance roll.

While the character does so, he cannot see, hear or smell anything that\u2019s happening around his body.

After spending the appropriate Legend and Willpower, the Scion\u2019s player rolls (Manipulation + Empathy) against the target\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend). If the player invoking Mirror of Lunacy scores more successes, then the Boon takes hold: The targeted Scion sees himself in the reflection and suddenly realizes the extent of his madness. This causes the subject to immediately snap out of his Virtue extremity, although it does not necessarily prevent him from taking other rash actions in order to \u201cset right\u201d any mistakes that he may have made during that time.
