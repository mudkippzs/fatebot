He joins battle as soon as the attack occurs, and he applies his full DV to his own defense. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the attackers use supernatural means of concealment or not. They simply cannot catch him off guard. Unfortunately, this Knack doesn\u2019t help the Scion\u2019s comrades. The Scion reacts as the surprise occurs, but he does so practically subconsciously and not in time to warn anyone else. What\u2019s more, this Knack works even if the Scion is asleep, though to a lesser extent. If the Scion is sleeping and someone tries to spring an unexpected attack, the player rolls the Scion\u2019s full dice pool to notice the attack as he would if the character were awake (awake and didn\u2019t have this Knack, that is).

If the Scion spends one additional Legend point per person, each person suffers an additional Virtue Extremity. That is, if he wants to affect five people with one Virtue Extremity, he must spend only five Legend points. If he wants them to suffer two Virtue Extremities, he must spend 10 Legend points. If he wants to affect all five people with the Virtue Extremity from all four of his Virtues, he must spend 20 Legend points. The Scion can choose how many of the present targets he wishes to affect, but he must affect them all with the same number of Virtue Extremities."

It acts by the Scion\u2019s will, but takes its own actions. As an abstract concept given form, though, the mystic helper cannot do anything but move and use Boons. It also uses the Scion\u2019s Legend to power those Boons. No mundane force can harm an Amesha Spenta, but attacks backed by Epic Attributes, Arete, or other supernatural means deal damage as normal. The Amesha Spenta has soak equal to the Scion\u2019s natural soak (including Epic Stamina) and it has five \u20130 Health levels. \nThis Boon may be used once per scene. The Amesha Spenta lasts for one minute per success on the activation roll. \nThe Scion may also select a fifth Amesha Spenta to associate with Asha, as per the previous Boon."
