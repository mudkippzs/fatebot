This Boon generates a number of large plants (or a number of square yards of a patch of smaller plants) equal to the successes achieved on the roll plus the Scion\u2019s Legend.

The Scion could grow mushrooms on the desert floor or cause rose bushes to thrive in a submerged cave off the continental shelf. Per Green Thumb, these created plants survive for one year under any conditions barring blight or physical destruction by living creatures. When that year is up, they react to their surroundings as normal plants of their type would. In the meantime, they are as susceptible to other Fertility Boons as any normal plants are."
