Doing so costs one Willpower, and the command must be one the Scion can give and the victim can perform in a single action. \u201cFreeze!\u201d is acceptable, as is, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d or, \u201cShoot him!\u201d Ordering someone to go home and shoot his wife won\u2019t work because doing so would take longer than a single action. A victim of this Knack can interpret the command loosely to make it not directly suicidal, but not if all he\u2019s trying to do is keep out of trouble. For example, if a victim draws a gun and the Scion commands him to shoot himself, the victim can shoot himself in the hand or the foot rather than blowing his own brains out. Same thing goes if a Scion uses this Knack at a seedy pool hall to command a smarmy drug dealer to pick a \ufb01ght with a burly ex-con at the next table. The dealer might reasonably believe that the ex-con could kill him, but he still can\u2019t weasel out of the command. He doesn\u2019t have to walk up and take a swing at the guy, but he still has to do something, such as singing out a racial slur or throwing a beer bottle at the guy\u2019s girlfriend. The dealer can cheese it immediately, but he\u2019s still got to pick the \ufb01ght \ufb01rst.",

Scions who engage in this practice learn to absorb the capabilities of an animal by devouring such a creature and drawing forth its essence from the digested flesh. The Scion must eat a piece of meat from the appropriate animal (a potentially risky act, considering that the animal is probably considered sacred to his patron God). Then, the player expends the Willpower and Legend and rolls (Stamina + Animal Ken). The successes scored indicate the number of points of Abilities that the Scion may borrow from the animal. A Scion can only borrow Abilities up to the level possessed by the animal, although these dots can add on to his existing skill dots to a maximum total of five. Skills gained with Faunaphagia remain for the rest of the scene."
