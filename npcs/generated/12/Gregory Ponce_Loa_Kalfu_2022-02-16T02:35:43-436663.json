On a successful activation roll, the victim freezes in place, suddenly unable to think, speak or act. He\u2019s unaware of what goes on around him, and he has no memory of the moments before or after the use of this Boon. The effect lasts for a number of actions equal to the successes on the activation roll, and it erases the victim\u2019s memory for an equal amount of time before the roll. If the victim has more dots of Legend than the user, the power doesn\u2019t work. If the victim has an equal Legend rating, the activation roll is contested against the victim\u2019s (Willpower + Integrity + Legend)."
