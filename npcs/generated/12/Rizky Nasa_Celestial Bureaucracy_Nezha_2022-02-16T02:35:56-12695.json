This Knack, however, doubles a Scion\u2019s vertical and horizontal jumping distances.

With this Knack, any tool or item that the Scion picks up benefits from the same bends and loopholes in the laws of physics that allow Epic Strength to defy both leverage and structural integrity. The Scion could use a wooden board to clobber a thug, or he could ram a flimsy iron fireplace poker right through a wall of concrete with the full force of his Epic Strength. In either case, the tool would remain reasonably intact (albeit with some cosmetic wear). Such guarantees are particularly handy when using an object of questionable strength to beat a titanspawn to death without destroying the item in question (such as a snow globe intended as a present). Note that Titanium Tools doesn\u2019t improve the Hardness or rigidity of an item. A cheap katana can still be snapped in half by an angry titanspawn that decides to target the blade. A limp spaghetti noodle is no better a weapon with this Knack than without.

Yet, it\u2019s undeniably sweeter to let some pompous douchebag take the first swing and then utterly annihilate him with a cunning verbal riposte. To hit an attacker with a devastating comeback costs a single point of Legend. Doing so strips the victim of all of his spent Willpower points and doesn\u2019t allow him to recoup those lost points for one full day. A character can use this Knack to defend herself from a use of Opening Salvo if she has the Legend point to spend and her comeback is timely enough. A victim, however, can defend himself from a use of this Knack if he also uses this Knack. (He can retort without using the Knack, of course, but he still suffers the effect.) If two characters use this Knack in a verbal exchange, they can activate it once apiece and then trade insults until one scores a decisive hit over the other. If that victim\u2019s comeback is weaker than the one before it, he loses the impromptu contest and the Willpower points. As with Opening Salvo, the player must actually come up with a retort reasonably quickly. She doesn\u2019t have to be Hamlet running circles around Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, she just has to give it the old college try.

The best makeup and disguise means nothing if the imposter can\u2019t react to life\u2019s little surprises exactly as the subject of his mimicry would react.

For the most part, this Knack plays itself out without resorting to dice rolls or trait comparisons.

This Knack does not provide a supernatural disguise that would fool someone with the Unfailing Recognition Knack (from Scion: Hero, p. 134), but even if such a Scion can see through the imposter\u2019s disguise, his recognition alone would not be enough to convince anyone else.

            "Dice Pool: Charisma + Command \nCost: 5+ Legend \nWith this Boon, a God turns faithful mortal worshipers into powerful servants of living flame. If the mortals are willing to undergo the transformation, the God lays a hand on each mortal\u2019s forehead and imbues him or her with the spirit of the living flame. In a moment of intense, unutterable pain, the mortal spasms and collapses with his veins glowing white hot through his skin and smoke pouring from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth. A moment later, the mortal\u2019s flesh burns away entirely and he rises as a blackened skeleton surrounded by swirling yellow fire. To activate this Boon, the God\u2019s player spends five Legend points and rolls (Charisma + Command). With the base activation, the God can transform a number of willing mortals equal to his Legend. Each additional Legend point he spends adds another number of willing mortals equal to his Legend."

With this Boon, a Scion removes both necessities from a single flame for one scene. He could keep a single torch (or even a match) lit for hours as he explores a dark labyrinth. He could cause the tiny spark at the end of a fuse to burn in place without moving. This Boon is also good for keeping a source of flame from consuming the breathable air in an enclosed space."

He shapes his own Qi into the perfect negation of the power used against him, the Yin to its Yang. This is much easier, however, against powers the Scion has experience at using himself."

Many such artists prefer to sculpt clouds while looking through a window, as the glass pane gives them something solid to bear down on and trace out their sky designs.

His features are unrecognizable except in silhouette (if he has a distinctive silhouette), and his voice has the quality of a roaring bonfire. In this form, the character\u2019s merest touch can set things alight or burn flesh. Touching the character inflicts a number of levels of lethal damage equal to his Legend. If the character physically attacks someone, the player adds that many extra levels of lethal damage to the results of his damage roll. The flames of the Scion\u2019s body can even burn a fellow Scion who has Fire Immunity (Fire 1) if that Scion\u2019s Legend is lower, though the lesser Scion suffers automatic fire damage equal to only the difference in their Legend ratings. The character\u2019s semisolid form also absorbs an amount of damage equal to the character\u2019s Legend from all physical attacks."

The most graphic example of this is thunder, which is commonly associated with sky gods; wind, too, is said to howl or moan, as if the sky itself has a voice. A demigod who delves into the nature of thunder and sound can learn to manipulate the currents of air that carry sound and thereby enhance or dampen sonic effects."
