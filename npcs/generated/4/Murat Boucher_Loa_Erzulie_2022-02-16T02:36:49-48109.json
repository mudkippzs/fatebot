As long as his words are intended to inspire them in some way, every person who can hear him listens spellbound and receives a point of Willpower at the speech\u2019s end. The only limit is that the listeners must be able to hear him clearly without him using the aid of any amplifying or broadcasting equipment.

For the cost of one Legend point, the character can change some minor physical detail such as eye color, hair length, hair color, hairstyle or skin tone. She can change her height by three inches in either direction of the standard and change her apparent weight and muscle tone by 10 percent of the standard. The character can also use this Knack to go from filthy to perfectly clean in an instant, as well as to remove any minor scars from past injuries.

Once the clothing exists, it takes on the texture and solidity of whatever fabric the character prefers. The character can even create clothing that looks and feels like any sort of armor, but armor created thus offers no soak benefits. No Mobility Penalty or Fatigue value either, though, so that\u2019s nice.
