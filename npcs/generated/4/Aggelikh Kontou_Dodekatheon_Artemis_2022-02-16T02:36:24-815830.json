When a Scion has this Knack, however, he becomes the whirlwind for which it is named and can defend himself better than mortals or even his Scion peers. Upon activating the Knack, the Scion can apply his full Parry DV to attacks made with thrown items (javelins, chakrams, sling stones, etc.) or with bows or crossbows. He can knock the projectiles aside or snag them out of the air armed or unarmed, almost without thinking about it. With a stunt, the character can even try to parry bullets. He can do so only with some sort of object that can actually withstand a bullet\u2019s impact, though\u2014such as an iron skillet, a Birthright gauntlet or the side of his own gun\u2019s barrel.

                "Most Scions seem to stumble into Bands or find themselves guided into collaboration by their divine parents. A rare few, though, have the ability to smell (and sometimes hear) the very ichor that flows in the veins of other Scions. With just a sniff of the air, the Scion catches the signature scent that wafts off any Scion, marking the subject as more than mortal. The Scion automatically knows when she scents another Scion, be it hero, demigod or God. Indeed, her refined sense may even divulge the pantheon from which the other Scion hails, in the form of a specific flavor or memory that comes with the smell. Sometimes the triggered memory even brings with it the phantom sound of a particular music or tone. If a subject uses a Boon or Knack to conceal his identity or whereabouts, the sniffng Scion must first be able to locate the target. If she isn\u2019t aware of the other Scion\u2019s presence, then the sniffer won\u2019t smell anything. This power doesn\u2019t tell her that another Scion is lurking about somewhere, only that someone she\u2019s spotted is a Scion. Scions in general do not have individual, personalized scents of ichor, although at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion a God might be so powerful that his ichor is unique and distinct. Instead, a Scion\u2019s scent depends upon his parentage. Further, even though a Scion with this Knack might catch the scent of a particular pantheon, she might not recognize what it is until she\u2019s managed to encounter enough other Scions from said pantheon. If you have created other pantheons for use in your game, you\u2019ll want to decide on their scents as well. Note also that titanspawn do not have a signature scent that is discernable with this Knack. Activating this Knack costs one point of Legend."

                "Prerequisite Knack: Trick Shooter (Scion: Hero, p. 128) When fighting against fearsome titanspawn with armored hides, scaly skin or chitinous shells, sometimes a Scion has to aim for a very precise spot. Indeed, it was just such a weak spot that was the downfall of Achilles. Naturally, that sort of precision can be hard to achieve in the heat of battle, especially against a target with a supernaturally impressive defense. With the steady aim provided by Shot to the Heart, though, a Scion never needs to worry about hitting a small patch of exposed flesh, a vulnerable tendon or an eye between blinks \u2014 his attacks excel at finding the weak point. While Shot to the Heart is active, the Scion reduces any penalty for attacking a specific weak point by an amount up to his Epic Dexterity score. That is, if a giant turtle-like titanspawn has a weak spot in its soft underbelly, but striking the unarmored area has a difficulty of 5 and the attacking Scion has an Epic Dexterity of 3, then the Scion reduces the difficulty of making such a targeted shot to difficulty 2. Shot to the Heart can\u2019t reduce the added difficulty of a targeted shot to less than zero \u2014 making an attack on a vital spot is never easier than just hitting the damn thing. Also, Shot to the Heart doesn\u2019t give the Scion any innate knowledge of where a vital spot might be; it just lets him target the spot more effectively if he knows where to find one. While Shot to the Heart requires a Knack typically used with ranged combat as a prerequisite, this Knack can be used with any of the Scion\u2019s attacks. Activating this Knack costs three points of Legend. Its effects last for one scene.",
