Writing the language is a bit trickier, as he can only transliterate his written words in the alphabet of his native language until someone teaches him the alphabet and punctuation of the new language. For instance, say a Scion with this Knack whose native language is English has picked up French at Orly Airport in Paris and would like to leave a thank-you note for a bartender who gave him helpful information. That Scion might write, \u201cMare- see du mah-vay zayday,\u201d to express his thanks, when what he really means is, \u201cMerci de m\u2019avez aid\u00e9.\u201d Likewise, reading the new language can be dif\ufb01cult if that language uses characters that don\u2019t appear in an alphabet with which he is already familiar.",

A charmed person can still think clearly, question one\u2019s motives and turn someone down if something about what she\u2019s saying doesn\u2019t feel quite right. Not so the person affected by this Knack. The character who uses it spends one Legend point as his player rolls (Charisma + Presence + Legend). The victim\u2019s player contests this effect with a (Willpower + Integrity + Legend) roll. If the victim\u2019s roll fails to garner the necessary successes, the victim falls madly, unquestioningly in love with the user of the Knack for a number of days equal to the user\u2019s threshold successes. The victim is blindly enthralled and will do anything in her power to please the object of her affection. This Knack works regardless of the relative Legend disparity between the user and his victim. Using it unwisely against a more powerful character is ill advised, however. Fool Odin once, shame on him. Fool him twice, wolves on you.",

Yet where Language Mastery requires that the character listen for a while to get a sense of the strange language\u2019s ebb and flow, this Knack allows the character to understand anything that is said to him in any language the moment it is spoken. Where this Knack truly surpasses its prerequisite is that it allows the character to read any written language with which he isn\u2019t familiar, even if it\u2019s written in characters that are completely alien to him. He can\u2019t automatically write with perfect fluency in a new language he can speak or has read, but his written vocabulary is as broad as every word in that language that he has read.",

This Knack works exactly as its prerequisite, and functions under the same limitations, but it is more effective. Mortals and Scions who hear it are so inspired that their spent Willpower points are entirely re\ufb01lled. This Knack also has a more insidious dimension. If the Scion \ufb01nds himself in charge of a group of titanspawn, he can spend a point of Willpower and give those awful minions a speech that empowers them just as Inspirational Figure inspires mortals. Each titanspawn who hears him regains a point of spent Willpower. Scions who might be opposed to the titanspawn\u2019s goals don\u2019t receive any bene\ufb01t from this inspirational speech, but they are compelled to let the demigod \ufb01nish what he has to say before they do something about it.",
