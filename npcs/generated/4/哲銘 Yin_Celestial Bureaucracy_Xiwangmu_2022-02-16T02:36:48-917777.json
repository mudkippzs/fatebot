The Scion could, for instance, glance at the controls of a stealth bomber, then intuitively figure out how to get it off the ground (or land it) as if she had one dot in the Control (Jet Aircraft) Ability. Similarly, a noncombatant could pick up a weapon and fight with it as if she had one dot of the Melee Ability. This Knack has no effect if the Scion already possesses the requisite skill."

                "If someone is trying to hit a target with a thrown object, the best thing for the target to do is get down behind cover or tuck in behind a shield. If the person trying to hit the target is a Scion with this Knack, however, not even such measures guarantee total safety. Before he lets loose, the Scion re\ufb02exively takes in the contours of the surroundings (as the player spends a point of Legend). He then throws his item in a seemingly random direction that nonetheless sends it ringing and bouncing off nearby surfaces to completely circumvent the target\u2019s cover or shield, thus negating its DV bonus. The Scion\u2019s throw can incorporate a number of ricochets equal to his Epic Dexterity dots, and each ricochet negates a point of DV modi\ufb01er that comes from cover or a shield. If the Scion is trying to not only hit the target but also disarm him or otherwise show off (more so), each ricochet can mitigate the penalty for doing so as well if he has ricochets left over. The general rule here is that one ricochet takes away one point of penalty on the throw\u2019s roll due to cover, a shield, showing off or attempting to disarm the target. When the thrown item \ufb01nally hits the target, it does so at its full force, regardless of how many times it bounced off walls, \ufb02oors, light \ufb01xtures, other enemies\u2019 helmets or what have you.

As long as he keeps dashing, his feet skim the surface of the water or muck like a skipping stone.

She cannot take Dash actions on such surfaces, but her Epic Dexterity bonuses apply to her Move rate as usual.
