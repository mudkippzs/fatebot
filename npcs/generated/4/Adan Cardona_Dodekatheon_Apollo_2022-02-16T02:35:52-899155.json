People affected by this Knack run away with self-preservation in mind, though, so they won\u2019t sprint blindly into traffic or try to swim across a shark tank to safety.

The charismatic Scion can even replenish a measure of the same for one of his fellow Scions. A demigod Scion\u2019s attention makes a person feel even more important, though, especially when the Scion goes out of his way to treat the person like a true friend. When the demigod does so (and spends a point of Legend), he completely re\ufb01 lls a fellow Scion\u2019s spent Willpower points (if that amount is higher than the charismatic Scion\u2019s Epic Charisma). Should he treat a mortal with such affection, the mortal not only regains all his spent Willpower, as per Blessing of Importance, he gains an extra dot of Willpower for the scene. When that extra dot goes away at the end of the scene, the mortal\u2019s spent Willpower completely replenishes again. The Scion can affect a person only once per scene with this Knack.",

A hideous Scion in\ufb02icts quite the opposite effect. The fear she instills robs her victim of a Willpower point that he cannot regain until the effect wears off.
