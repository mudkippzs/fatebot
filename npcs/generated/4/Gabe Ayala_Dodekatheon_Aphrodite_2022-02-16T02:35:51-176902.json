                "Prerequisite Knack: Detail Variation Combining elements of the two Knacks it takes to get to this one, the character can make more radical alterations to the way he looks. He can change racial characteristics or make dramatic changes in his weight or height. He can even change genders (and be completely fertile in the new form) or exhibit characteristics of both (and be fertile in both). Any morphology and physiognomy that exists on the spectrum of human variety is a valid change. When the character is finished, his new Appearance can be from one dot to as many dots as he actually has. His Epic Appearance dots are automatically included at their full value, but they can be suppressed normally with My Eyes Are Up Here. The character can also use this Knack to perfectly mimic the appearance of anyone he has seen. Doing so requires a (Dexterity + Empathy) roll with a difficulty equal to (1 + that person\u2019s Legend). More generic alteration requires no roll, but any use of this Knack costs five Legend points to realize the finish product.",

                "Prerequisite Knack: Rumor Mill (Scion: Demigod, p. 61) A character with Rumor Mill can plant some idea in the fertile soil of the public consciousness and watch it blossom into either a well-known fact or a notorious urban legend. This Knack works on a similar principle, but rather than affecting what people believe, it affects how they act. The character goes out in public and performs some innocuous action in a unique way\u2014 high-fiving himself when he\u2019s happy, for instance\u2014utters a personal catch phrase\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m stressing\u201d\u2014or adopts some distinctive mode of dress\u2014such as wearing his blue Nikes untied and on the wrong feet. If he chooses to activate this Knack when doing so, his player spends two points of Legend and makes a (Manipulation + Presence) roll. If people see him doing this unique and interesting thing while using this Knack, the behavior catches on as the latest fad. The extent to which it becomes a widespread mania is as follows:<br/><table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>Successes</td>\n<td>Who\u2019s Doing It?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Everybody in the neighborhood</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Everybody in the city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Everybody in cities throughout the region</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>Everybody in cities through the nation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>Everybody in the nation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>Everybody in that hemisphere</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>45</td>\n<td>Everybody in the World</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50+</td>\n<td>Even the Gods themselves are doing it</td>\n</tr>\n</table>",

Once everybody who\u2019s going to follow the trend is following the trend, it remains fashionable to do so for a number of weeks equal to the character\u2019s (Legend x 2). After that, it\u2019s up to the local glitterati whether the trend remains fashionable or is finally allowed to die with dignity.",

A character with this Knack doesn\u2019t have that problem. For the cost of one Legend point, the character can change some minor physical detail such as eye color, hair length, hair color, hairstyle or skin tone. She can change her height by three inches in either direction of the standard and change her apparent weight and muscle tone by 10 percent of the standard. The character can also use this Knack to go from filthy to perfectly clean in an instant, as well as to remove any minor scars from past injuries. Doing the latter doesn\u2019t heal damage or restore lost body parts, but it makes what\u2019s left over look less ugly.",
