He simply doesn\u2019t understand enough about what he\u2019s doing to apply his full talent. With this Knack, however, the character gets a feel for any activity remarkably quickly.

In such a circumstance, a player can enhance a roll with this Knack and add a number of bonus successes from his character\u2019s Epic Attribute equal to the number of dots he has in the Epic Attribute.

Actually winning that skeptical audience over after that is still up to the person the Scion tried to help. With Borrowed Credibility, however, the God can not only vouch for a subject in absentia, she can actually use her divine influence through a subject remotely. To do so, the God instructs a person to speak on her behalf, possibly going so far as to prepare a speech for him, and empowers that person with an expenditure of three Legend points. The God\u2019s player then rolls her character\u2019s full Charisma-based dice pool, adding in all available bonus successes. Thereafter, for a number of days equal to the God\u2019s Epic Charisma rating, the empowered person may substitute the God\u2019s player\u2019s roll result for his own player\u2019s use of the same dice pool. He must claim the God\u2019s authority when he does so, speaking in the divine figure\u2019s holy name. Characters with this Knack can use it on any willing emissary of equal or lesser Legend. (As the messenger of the Dodekatheon, for instance, Hermes has been a frequent recipient of this effect.) Its remote effect works on a single listener or on a whole group of people. Also, the character\u2019s instructions to her emissary cannot run counter to the effect of the Charisma-based roll she intends to bestow upon that emissary. She cannot, for instance, prepare what looks like a stirring battlefield address on paper but is actually intended to demoralize the troops through whom her chosen generals speaks.",

She cannot take Dash actions on such surfaces, but her Epic Dexterity bonuses apply to her Move rate as usual. She\u2019s still subject to gravity, though, so she has to make it a point to hang on while she\u2019s climbing thus. Therefore, she cannot take multiple actions while climbing such surfaces.
