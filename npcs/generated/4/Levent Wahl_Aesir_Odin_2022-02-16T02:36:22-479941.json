The best makeup and disguise means nothing if the imposter can\u2019t react to life\u2019s little surprises exactly as the subject of his mimicry would react. With this Knack, however, the Scion can discern with preternatural quickness how the people who think he\u2019s someone else expect that someone else to react. Their minute changes of expression or body language give their expectations away, allowing the imposter to react accordingly. For the most part, this Knack plays itself out without resorting to dice rolls or trait comparisons. As the imposter\u2019s player roleplays (and the imposter himself does so also), the Storyteller simply informs him of what the unsuspecting characters\u2019 expectations are, and the player chooses his imposter\u2019s reactions accordingly. This Knack does not provide a supernatural disguise that would fool someone with the Unfailing Recognition Knack (from Scion: Hero, p. 134), but even if such a Scion can see through the imposter\u2019s disguise, his recognition alone would not be enough to convince anyone else. The imposter retains the wherewithal to stand up to any impromptu interrogation and maintain his charade in everyone else\u2019s eyes, thus making the only other Scion who knows the imposter\u2019s true identity look like a horse\u2019s ass or a liar.",

The charismatic Scion can even replenish a measure of the same for one of his fellow Scions. A demigod Scion\u2019s attention makes a person feel even more important, though, especially when the Scion goes out of his way to treat the person like a true friend. When the demigod does so (and spends a point of Legend), he completely re\ufb01 lls a fellow Scion\u2019s spent Willpower points (if that amount is higher than the charismatic Scion\u2019s Epic Charisma). Should he treat a mortal with such affection, the mortal not only regains all his spent Willpower, as per Blessing of Importance, he gains an extra dot of Willpower for the scene. When that extra dot goes away at the end of the scene, the mortal\u2019s spent Willpower completely replenishes again. The Scion can affect a person only once per scene with this Knack.",

At the very least, you want to know if the minion was killed in the attempt. With Return to Sender, the Scion prompts someone to return immediately to her after performing a task delegated with Epic Manipulation. The player spends an additional point of Legend to activate this power when using any other Epic Manipulation Knack to force a subject to take an action. Immediately after performing the order, the commanded subject will attempt to return to the Scion by the most convenient means possible, although not at the expense of his own safety. If the initial command fails, then Return to Sender has no effect, but the Legend point is still expended.",

This assessment comes across in terms of how the foe\u2019s combat abilities compare to the Scion\u2019s own. He gets a sense of whether the foe has more or fewer dots of Physical Attributes (Epic and otherwise) than he does. The same goes for their relative number of dots in Brawl, Marksmanship, Melee and Thrown, as well as their relative Join Battle dice pools and their soak totals. Also, if some power or special quality renders the foe especially vulnerable or completely invulnerable to something to which the Scion has ready access, the Scion gets a sense of that as well. What the Scion decides to do with this information is up to him. This information occurs re\ufb02exively to the Scion who uses the Knack, and he may assess as many foes automatically as he spends points of Legend.",
