                "With this Knack, a Scion turns a group of people into his own Rube Goldberg machine. Taking only a moment to glance around the room at what the people around him are doing, the Scion decides what result he wants to achieve and takes the \ufb01rst small step toward achieving that end. The effect can take no more than a scene to accomplish, and it can be no more than a personal, temporal gain for himself.",
                "For Example: A Scion of Ogoun is at a bar having a drink when up pulls the motorcycle of the Scion of Sobek from whom he stole an expensive and powerful Birthright. The Scion of Ogoun needs a distraction so he can slip out the back before the Scion of Sobek notices him and turns him into mincemeat. After a quick glance around, the Scion of Ogoun motions to the bartender and orders a drink for a pretty girl across the room. He also pays off his tab. As the waitress takes the drink over, a sour-faced middle-aged man exits the restroom and walks back toward the table where his shrewish wife is waiting. The waitress hands the drink to the pretty girl and points back toward the Scion of Ogoun, but the middle-aged man just happens to be in the way. The pretty girl waves and smiles her thanks, and the middle-aged man smiles back in distracted confusion as the Scion of Ogoun tips the girl a wink. It\u2019s at this point that the Scion of Sobek enters and notices the Scion of Ogoun putting on his jacket. As the Scion of Sobek comes toward the Scion of Ogoun\u2019s seat, the middle-aged man meets his shrewish wife heading toward him. Having misinterpreted the pretty girl\u2019s wave of thanks to the Scion of Ogoun, she demands to know why her husband bought a strange girl a drink. She throws her own drink in his face, sending him tripping over his own feet and stumbling backward toward the Scion of Sobek. That Scion stops and catches the middle-aged guy before the poor fellow can crack his head against the corner of a nearby table. Yet when the Scion looks back up to \ufb01nd his prey again, the Scion of Ogoun is nowhere to be seen.",
                "Using this Knack doesn\u2019t have to be that complicated. As long as the player and Storyteller can come up with a quick sequence of convenient, coincidental events that spring from the Scion\u2019s \ufb01rst small action, that\u2019s all that\u2019s required. The important thing is to keep each of the events low key and not to hog too much of the spotlight in so doing.",

If he doesn\u2019t learn to focus his mind on one sound, one image, one sensation to the exclusion of all others, he can all too easily be carried away by the riot and cacophony all around him. With this Knack, a character need never worry about such a thing. He can divide his attention equally between every source of input to which he is exposed, to the detriment of none. He could absorb and comprehend every conversation in a room. He could watch and follow every television program on the bank of monitors before him. By smell alone, he could point out every flower in a flower shop with his eyes closed. With the preceding Knack, he could hear every prayer addressed to him at the same time. With the second application of Clairvoyance, he could instantly judge the results of a chili cook-off from across the room. Regardless of how many things he can sense simultaneously, however, he can still do only one thing at a time unless he has the Multitasking Knack (from Scion: Demigod, p. 65). Also, using this Knack for a scene costs three Legend points.",

A Scion might be accident- prone or have an infuriating talent for picking \ufb01ghts with titanspawn that are out of her league, but she takes her lumps with a smile and inspires her fellows with her can-do attitude.

                "Prerequisite Knack: Rumor Mill (Scion: Demigod, p. 61) A character with Rumor Mill can plant some idea in the fertile soil of the public consciousness and watch it blossom into either a well-known fact or a notorious urban legend. This Knack works on a similar principle, but rather than affecting what people believe, it affects how they act. The character goes out in public and performs some innocuous action in a unique way\u2014 high-fiving himself when he\u2019s happy, for instance\u2014utters a personal catch phrase\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m stressing\u201d\u2014or adopts some distinctive mode of dress\u2014such as wearing his blue Nikes untied and on the wrong feet. If he chooses to activate this Knack when doing so, his player spends two points of Legend and makes a (Manipulation + Presence) roll. If people see him doing this unique and interesting thing while using this Knack, the behavior catches on as the latest fad. The extent to which it becomes a widespread mania is as follows:<br/><table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>Successes</td>\n<td>Who\u2019s Doing It?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Everybody in the neighborhood</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Everybody in the city</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Everybody in cities throughout the region</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>Everybody in cities through the nation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>Everybody in the nation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>Everybody in that hemisphere</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>45</td>\n<td>Everybody in the World</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50+</td>\n<td>Even the Gods themselves are doing it</td>\n</tr>\n</table>",

Once everybody who\u2019s going to follow the trend is following the trend, it remains fashionable to do so for a number of weeks equal to the character\u2019s (Legend x 2). After that, it\u2019s up to the local glitterati whether the trend remains fashionable or is finally allowed to die with dignity.",
