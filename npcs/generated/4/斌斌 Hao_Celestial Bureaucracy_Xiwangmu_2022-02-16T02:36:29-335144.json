                "Prerequisite Knack: Lightning Sprinter (see Scion: Hero, p. 127) A Scion who possesses this Knack becomes extraordinarily fleet of foot. She can outrun nearly anything that lacks divinely empowered speed and has a good chance of winning most races against such opponents as well. This Knack doubles the distance she can cover in a Dash action, after calculating the bonus for Epic Dexterity and the prerequisite Knack. Her long term running speed is similarly increased, allowing her to cross large distances on foot quickly. In addition, the Scion\u2019s prodigious speed enables her to defy gravity for short periods. She can run across short gaps, up steep inclines and even over low walls without pause. With this knack, a Scion can traverse any incline of less than 60 degrees for any distance and travel up a wall or across a gap of (Legend x 5) feet. She must already be running to traverse these obstacles. If she should slow down or stop, she falls or otherwise cannot scale the wall or pass the obstacle. Activating this Knack costs one point of Legend, and its effects last one scene.",

The attack still in\ufb02icts its knockback, though, seemingly knocking the Scion completely out of his skin. The empty husk collapses at the attacker\u2019s feet, disintegrating over three ticks.

Only the normal Epic Dexterity bonus applies to the character\u2019s Parry DV, though, and this Knack\u2019s bonus to Dodge DV doesn\u2019t apply if the character is merely hiding behind cover or tucked in behind a scutum like a lowly turtle.
