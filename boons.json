A mortal hunter with a trusty hound could walk right over the Scion\u2019s disguised back and never know she was there. Hunters of supernatural prowess fare only a little better. Those with the Epic Perception Knack Predatory Focus or a Survival Arete can attempt to track the hidden Scion\u2019s movements, their players rolling (Perception + Survival) against the hiding Scion\u2019s activation roll. Even if they get more successes than the Scion\u2019s player did, though, the hunters find only the general area in which the Scion is hiding. (They come to an area within a number of yards equal to the Scion\u2019s Legend but lose track of her unless she moves again.) Only hunters with the Supernal Hunter Knack are actually skilled enough to find a Scion who\u2019s using this Boon to hide (and only if their rolls garner more successes than the Scion\u2019s)."

It can trap whole cities in dreamworlds. Even Gods have difficulty separating the lines between reality and fantasy. The Trickster can make any lie sound plausible or make any plan seem to be a good idea. The Trickster can even fool a Titan, causing the Titan to agree to a plot or even perceive The Trickster as a fellow Titan."

The spirit and energy that binds the World together is hidden beneath this concept. Every life, death and rebirth of an individual in some way acknowledges this truth, as Fate muddles the spiritual in a shiny veneer of distractions and sensual pleasures. Every spin through samsara's cycle is inured with this illusion. Yet the Devas have a way of using Fate's perpetually rotating trick to their advantage. Unlike the Illusion Purview (detailed in Scion: Ragnarok), which can create landscapes of unreality or morph objects of people entirely, the Devas halt Fate's cycle enough to replicate the illusion of past lives. After spending the appropriate Legend, the Scion's player rolls (Manipulation + Presense). For every success garnered on this roll without counting successes from Epic Manipulation, the God creates an illusory duplicate of himself. These duplicated Gods look and act exactly as the God using this power. In fact, in some fashion, they are the God, or at least an aspect ripped from her previous existences."

To use this power, a Scion must sit in a meditative trance for one hour without interruption (generally in a yogic position).

            "description": "Dice Pool: None \nCost: 2 Legend per item per action \nAs demigods master the Great Principle, they can manipulate objects using currents of Qi in a form of telekinesis. A Scion could wrestle someone without touching him, wield one weapon while another dances in the air beside her, or type at a computer keyboard while peeking in through a window. Anything a person can do by hand, the Qi Hand can do as well. Actions involving the Qi Hand use the same dice pools as they would if the character performed the action himself. For instance, wielding a sword using the Qi Hand would call for a (Dexterity + Melee) roll. The Strength of the Qi Hand equals the character\u2019s Legend, so a physically frail Scion could use her Qi Hand to send burly bikers flying."
