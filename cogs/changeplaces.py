"""
1. Create a discord bot cog that should generate a random number between 1 and 100 at midnight (GMT+1).
3. If the result is 88, 100, 1, 72, 46, 69 then: disable 'change nickname' server permission; for users with 'members' role, and then randomly swap nicknames of all members.
4. No two members should have the same nickname, and no member should have their own nickname and the swap should be random.
5. Send all output to the 游닉announcements游닉 channel and send the gif: https://c.tenor.com/BU7jcFyIrPoAAAAC/futurama-change-places.gif and @everyone.
6. Reverse the nickname swap after 24 hours.
7. Include a command to trigger this manually instead of waiting for the timer.
